Service relations facilitate the automation of service reuse. Most of studies on the service relations focus on the inputs and outputs. However, different Web Services tend to utilize the same parameters without formally specifying their constraints. Due to this, the semantics, introduced by semantic annotation, is still not rich enough for accurate descriptions, thus generating a large number of inappropriate service relations. To address this, we propose an approach for augmenting semantics of Web Services based on constraints, which can be regarded as a complement to semantic annotation. The semantics is augmented via a hybrid analysis of heterogeneous constraints, including the server constraint and object constraint.

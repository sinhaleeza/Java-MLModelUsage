In a typical large-scale data center, a set of applications are hosted over virtual machines (VMs) running on a large number of physical machines (PMs). Such a virtualization technique can be used for conserving power consumption by minimizing the number of PMs that should be turned on according to the application requirements to resource. However, the resource demands for VMs is dynamic in nature since the number of user requests the applications should handle is rapidly changing in practice. It is a great challenge to online reconfigure the VMs (i.e., optimize the number and the locations for the VMs) according to the dynamic resource demands. Especially for the emerging applications of large-scale data centers for cloud computing systems, existing approaches either fails to find a best configuration of VMs or cannot produce a result in an acceptable time. In this paper, we propose an online self-reconfiguration approach for reallocating VMs in large-scale data centers. It first accurately predicts the future workloads of the applications with Brown's quadratic exponential smoothing. Based on such a prediction, it adopts a genetic algorithm to efficiently find the optimal reconfiguration policy. The resource utilization of large-scale cloud computing data centers can thus be improved and their energy consumption can be greatly conserved. We conduct extensive experiments and the results verify that our approach can effectively switch off more unnecessary running PMs comparing with current approaches without a performance degradation of the whole system.

In the ocean dynamical environment real-time observing system of Taiwan Strait and adjacent maritime region, multiple observing data such as remote sensing data, structured data and so on are produced by the observing net from airspace, ocean surface, underwater space and ocean bottom. The data sharing and web service is a key part to influence the application efficiency of the whole system. According to the characteristics of the oceanic dynamical environment of Taiwan Strait, the construction scheme of the observing net is introduced in this paper firstly. Then the architecture of the observing data sharing and web service system is introduced, which includes five parts, i.e. the observing data acquiring module, the data integration module, the data processing and information production development module, and the data sharing and web service module. Next, the user classification system and service content classification are introduced. At last, the technology realization strategy and application in shipwreck salvation is introduced.

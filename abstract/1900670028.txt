Dynamic description logic (DDL) is among the few emerging service composition solutions through logical reasoning. To overcome low efficiency and lacking context-aware support of DDL reasoning, we propose a new DDL-based service composition model, which supports context-based service pre-filtering over DDL reasoning space. The pre-filtering runs under the BPEL workflow and a distributed reasoning algorithm need to reasoning different contexts after pre-filtering.

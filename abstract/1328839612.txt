In this paper, we present a model-driven, domain-centric tool allowing the specification of service-oriented applications through abstract services composition. Executable applications, made of concrete services, are automatically generated and deployed. This tool can be customized with domain-specific knowledge. Our contributions in this paper are to slightly extend the tool to be used in the demanding home computing domain. An approach for modelling and implementing dynamic service composition is provided for satisfying the dynamic home environment. This work has been carried out in collaboration with Schneider Electric.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been widely applied in a range of systems such as Embedded Systems, Enterprise Information Systems and Cyber Physical Systems. These systems nowadays show System of Systems (SoS) characteristics including large-scale, consisting of software and hardware components, and cooperative processes among independent systems. It is very important to validate functional requirements and evaluate non-functional requirements of systems precisely in earlier design phase by executable architecting methodology. This paper aims to provide an executable modeling approach to SOA by bringing together Model Driven Service Engineering (MDSE) with Service oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) and Modeling &amp; Simulation methodology based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). First, the business architecture and system architecture are built with SoaML, then the Extended DEVS Modeling Language (E-DEVSML) is used as a model transformation intermediary to make SOA models executable in an automated code generation process, finally, the early validation and evaluation of this SOA are done through a generated DEVS simulation. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach we introduce an aircraft docking process in an airport scenario as the case study.

Multimedia streaming means delivering continuous data to a plethora of client devices. Besides the actual data transport this also needs a high degree of content adaptation respecting the end users' needs given by the form of content preferences, transcoding constraints, and device capabilities.When it comes to content editing (like mixing in subtitles or picture-in-picture composition) relying on third party service providers may be necessary. For improved efficiency all adaptation should be done in a service-oriented way, because a lot of adaptation modules can be reused within different adaptation workflows. In this paper we discuss the extensions of Web service frameworks, and present a first implementation of a service-oriented framework for media streaming and digital item adaptation, concentrating on the technical realization of the services. Our experimental results show the practicality of the actual deployment of service-oriented multimedia frameworks.

The effectiveness of decision-making in agriculture domain can be improved by integrating current local environmental conditions with agricultural information system (AIS). To achieve this objective a series of functional blocks is proposed; which involves collection of environmental parameters from the farm, merging data from multiple sensors, communicating the collected data to the application server, extracting required information, defining ETL process, integration with ancillary data, analysis and presentation services. Web service based architecture comprising of distributed components is proposed to support the computational need. The proposed architecture extends analytical capabilities of end users with the help of multi dimensional expressions and OLAP.

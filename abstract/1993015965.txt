Although semantic-based composition approaches have brought some comprehensive advantages such as higher precisions and recalls, they are far from the real practice and hard to be applied in real-world applications due to the several challenging issues such as performance issues of time-consuming ontology reasoning, exponentially expanded searching time in large service repositories, lack of available and consensus ontologies, and higher using thresholds for users who do not have much semantic knowledge. To reduce these issues, in this paper, we present an innovative composition technique by building an Extended Quick Service Query List (EQSQL) for supporting more efficient and more realistic service composition. In EQSQL, data structures are specially designed to record service information and their associated semantic concepts by in advance processing semantic-related computing during service publication period. Particularly, WordNet and semantic similarities among multiple heterogeneous ontologies are exploited in our developed algorithms for forming EQSQL. As a result, EQSQL-based planning algorithm can not only achieve a quick response for a composition request, but guarantee the semantic composition quality as well. More importantly, our approaches can be scalable to the large service repositories and also significantly alleviate users or developers from the burden of using complicated semantic service composition, thus making service composition easier and more realistic. Our final experiments further demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of our proposed approaches.

Our paper provides a method to manage sustainable service levels in call centers. We defined a service level management process and a related capacity and workforce management that considers Erlang-A operational model for staffing levels. Based on such model, we compute the minimum sustainable price for a service contract based on the fixed service levels, and enable transparent pricing against a certified service level. The model has been implemented in a tool and are being tested in real call centers.

Retrieving matchings between process models becomes a significant challenge in many applications. Recent attempts have been done to measure similarity of process models based on graph-edit distance. This problem is known to be difficult and computational complexity of exact algorithms for graph matching is exponential. Thus, heuristics must be proposed to obtain approximations. In this paper, we propose an approach to find relevant process models based on their decomposition into paths of possible execution sequences. Then, we propose a schema to compute the similarity between two process models using the proposed decomposition. Moreover, we give particular attention to the problem of ranking a collection of process models according to a particular query.

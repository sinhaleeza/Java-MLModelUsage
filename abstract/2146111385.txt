We address the infrastructure of chord-like networks union. Chord merger is not a good idea for security reason. In this paper we propose Hamming metric union in chord-like networks from the initial view of alleviating the security problem, in which intra-network and inter-network routing are served based on a two dimensional structure. We discuss the routing procedure in detail where network shifted neighbor selection and nearest destination Hamming weight forwarding are explored. It has been proved that this routing in the united chord network is more efficient than chord itself.

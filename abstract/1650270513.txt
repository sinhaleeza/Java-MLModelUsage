Web services are more frequently accessed from a broad range of mobile users. Service composition integrates existing services to fulfill more complex tasks facing more dynamic environment. Pattern based service composition has been proven as an appealing approach to accelerate the service composition. This paper proposes a novel pattern based dynamic service composition framework that integrates elaborately designed pattern generation and pattern enforcement approaches to produce composited services. The pattern generation is formalized as a special graph similarity matching problem and an algorithm is designed to calculate the similarity of these service composition solutions. Patterns are chosen out of the solutions by similarity with specific criteria and applied for fast service composition out of the services in the repository. The pattern enforcement applies pattern to produce service composition instances with dynamic quality based metrics. Benchmark and analysis show this framework accelerates dynamic service composition effectively and efficiently.

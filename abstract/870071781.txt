This paper provides a multi-agent negotiation based service composition approach to deal with end user on-demand service requirements. We introduce a system framework for service composition. In this framework, a workflow defines a generic and service-independent process model within which each service agent is able to select appropriate task node that fits for the end user requirement in run time. Specifically, agents will negotiate with one other to guarantee the satisfaction of the service consumers' requirements. This paper introduces a methodology of how to model a service composition as a constraint satisfaction problem and solve the problem by a multi-agent negotiation algorithm.

In this paper, we suggest a simple but efficient solution for the Web service composition. When we search Web services for composition, we visit the service which gives the biggest number of new responses, because then there is a higher probability to invoke more other Web services. And also we suggest optimization techniques to get optimized composition result. Optimization processes consist of two phases: one is to remove unnecessary Web services and the other is to find the best starting point of a composition. Test results show that the proposed composing and optimization methods can compose Web services in optimal length in fast way.

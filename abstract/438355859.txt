One of the difficulty in applying the concepts of semantic Web technology to a drug discovery is the creation of a software generated URI suitable both for ontology independent and ontology dependent properties of drugs. We propose the use of two types of URI; structure invariants (URI) to identify the ontology independent features and structure semi-invariants (OURI) to identify ontology dependent features. URI are defined by the most fundamental properties (chemical connectivity, bond type, etc.). OURI are defined from context dependent (semantic) properties (binding mode, chemical core).

Web service composition, i.e., WSC, has emerged as a promising way to integrate various distributed computing resources for complex application requirements. However, much computation time is needed to determine the optimal composite solution, which embarrasses the popularity of WSC in actual real time applications. In view of this challenge, in this paper, a heuristic service composition method, named LOEM (Local Optimization and Enumeration Method, LOEM), is proposed. It aims at filtering the candidates of each task to a small number of promising ones by local selection, and then enumerates all the composite solutions to pursue a near-to-optimal one. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of LOEM in dealing with the WSC problems.

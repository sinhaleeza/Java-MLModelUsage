Current Web services composition proposals, such as BPML, WSBPEL, WSCI, and OWLS, provide solutions for describing the control and data flows in Web service composition. However, such proposals remain at the descriptive level, without providing any kind of mechanisms or tool support for analysis and verification. Therefore, there is a growing interest for the verification techniques which enable designers to test and repair design errors even before actual running of the service, or allow designers to detect erroneous properties and formally verify whether the service process design does have certain desired properties. In this paper, we propose to verify Web services composition using an event driven approach. We assume Web services that are coordinated by a composition process expressed in WSBPEL and we use event calculus to specify the properties and requirements to be monitored.

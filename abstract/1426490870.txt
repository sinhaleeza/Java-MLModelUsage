In Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) environments, the trustworthiness of each service provider is critical for a service client when selecting one from a large pool of service providers. The trust value of a service provider is usually in the range of [0, 1] and is evaluated from the ratings given by service clients, which represent the subjective belief of service clients on the satisfaction of delivered services. So a trust value can be taken as a subjective probability, by which one party believes that another party can perform an action in a certain situation. Hence, subjective probability theory should be adopted in trust evaluation. In addition, in SOC environments, a service provider usually can invoke the services from other service providers forming a composite service. Thus, the global trust of a composite service should be evaluated based on both the subjective probability property of trust and complex invocation structures. In this paper, we first interpret the trust dependency caused by direct service invocations as conditional probability. Then, on the basis of trust dependency, we propose a Subjective probability based deductive (SELECTIVE) approach to evaluate the subjective global trustworthiness of a composite service. All these processes follow subjective probability theory and keep the subjective probability property of trust in evaluations. Our experimental results demonstrate that when compared with existing approaches our proposed SELECTIVE approach can yield more reasonable results.

As cloud computing platforms are widely accepted by more and more enterprises and individuals, the underlying cloud workflow systems accumulate large numbers of business process models. Retrieving and recommending the most similar process models according to the tenant's requirements become extremely important, for it is not only beneficial to promote the reuse of the existing model assets, but also helpful to reduce the error rate of the modeling process. Since the scales of cloud workflow repositories become bigger and bigger, developing efficient and exact query approaches is urgent. To this end, an improved two-stage exact query approach based on graph structure is proposed. In the filtering stage, the composite task index, which consists of the label, join-attribute and split-attribute of a task, is adopted to acquire candidate models, which can greatly reduce the number of process models needed to be tested by a time-consuming verification algorithm. In the verification stage, a novel subgraph isomorphism test based on task code is proposed to refine the candidate model set. Experiments are conducted on six synthetic model sets and two real model sets. The results demonstrate that the presented approach can significantly improve the query efficiency and reduce the query response time.

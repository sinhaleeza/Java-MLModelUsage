In Application Management Services (AMS), high resource utilization, effective resource planning and optimal assignment of service requests to resources are critical to success. Meeting these objectives requires a systematic and repeatable approach for determining the best way of measuring resource utilization, assessing workload and assigning service requests. In this paper, we present a two-step approach to help achieve the above objectives. We first measure the actual amount of effort that each resource spends on handling each service request (SR) based on a metadata model and a set of SR handling priority rules. Then, we proceed to measure resource utilization and assess SR assignment process based on the effort data calculated in step one.

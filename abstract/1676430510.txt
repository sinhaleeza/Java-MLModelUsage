A major drawback of using SOAP for application integration is its enormous demand for network bandwidth.

In this paper we will give a detailed survey of state of the art binary encoding strategies for SOAP and introduce a new experimental concept for SOAP compression, which makes use of the commonly available WSDL description of a SOAP Web service.

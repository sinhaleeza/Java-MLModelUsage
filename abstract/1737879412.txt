This paper examines advantages of cloud while supporting real-time service systems using Salesforce platform. We build here a service management platform for the Polish Billiards and Snooker Association (PBSA), based on a real-time system located in a cloud. It allows PBSA managers accomplish tasks in this system on-demand. And, it is deployed as a private cloud to grant an access only to the employees from the snooker organization.

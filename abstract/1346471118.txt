The number of web services has grown drastically. Then how to manage them efficiently in a service repository is an important issue to address. Given a special field, there often exists an efficient data structure for a class of objects, e.g., the Google' Bigtable is very suitable for webpages' storage and management. Based on the theory of the equivalence relations and quotient sets, this work proposes a multilevel index model for large-scale service repositories, which can be used to reduce the execution time of service discovery and composition. Its novel use of keys as inspired by the key in relational database can effectively remove the redundancy of the commonly-used inverted index. Its four function-based operations are for the first time proposed to manage and maintain services in a repository. The experiments validate that the proposed model is more efficient than the existing structures, i.e., sequential and inverted index ones.

In this paper, we present an autonomic service bus, named Cilia, dedicated to pervasive computing. We begin by presenting a use case related to pervasive health and by recalling the main requirements of that domain. In particular, we explain that autonomic features are absolutely necessary in a field characterized by important environmental dynamism and by the absence of skilled human administrators. We then present the main features of Cilia, including the Java embedded DSL and the runtime environment. Cilia autonomic abilities are then detailed. The framework provides a set of touch points to dynamically monitor and adapt mediation chains under execution. The framework also includes adapters implementing local control loops allowing runtime selection and substitution of devices. Cilia has been validated in a collaborative project, named Medical.

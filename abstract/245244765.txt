Semantic web service is proposed to support the automation of service discovery, composition and invocation. However, it is still difficult for common users to compose semantic web services or generate them from web services. In order to alleviate such pains, in this paper we present Flow Editor: a visual semantic web service composition tool based on OWL-S specification. It has several advantages, including visual service composition by drag-and-drop, semi-automatic semantic web service generation, visual control construct supports and so on. In practice, the tool is already applied to help users solve realistic problems by creating and exporting new on-demand services.

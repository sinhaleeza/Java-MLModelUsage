Online information sources including Weibo and Wechat bring huge impact to the society. Only a few words of network information can expand rapidly and catalyze the generation of a huge amount of information. Semantic computing on online social networks and research on topics about emergencies have great significance. In this article, a numerical model of text semantic analysis based on artificial neural network is proposed, and a semantic computational algorithm for social network texts as well as a discovery algorithm for emergencies is provided with reference to the information provided by the social nodes itself and the semantic of the text. Semantic vector of micro-information for nodes and closure extension of semantic extensions are defined in order to build up an equivalence of short sentences, and in turn realize the discovery of emergencies.

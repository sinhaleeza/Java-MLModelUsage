Web applications have played an important role in mobile computing since they are developed by standard web technology, easy to achieve portability and always up to date. As a widely adopted development fashion, mashup integrates data, computation and UI elements from multiple web-delivered services into a single web application, which is a promising way to develop applications for mobile devices. However, developing mobile web applications by mashup has faced two challenges: on one hand, the growing popularity of web-delivered services, especially those equipped with mobile features like LBS, increases the difficulty of finding proper services and connections between services to create situational applications, on the other hand, mobile computing yields for agile development and fast iteration to meet users everchanging requirements, imposing more burden on developers. This paper presents a graph-based approach to helping mobile developers create mobile web applications. Based on this graph model, algorithms by synthesizing different recommendation patterns are designed to assist mashup completion, such as finding the missing components, connections between them, or potentially relevant options.

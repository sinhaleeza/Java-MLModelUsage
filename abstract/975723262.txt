Advances in the areas of embedded systems, computing, and networking are leading to an infrastructure composed of millions of heterogeneous devices. These devices will not simply convey information but process it in transit, connect peer to peer, and form advanced collaborations. This "Internet of Things'' infrastructure will be strongly integrated with the environment, and its integration with the enterprise systems will not only further blur the line between business IT systems and the real world, but will change the way we design, deploy, and use services. New opportunities can emerge for businesses, which can now closely collaborate with the real world. The work presented here proposes an architecture for an effective integration of the Internet of Things in enterprise services.

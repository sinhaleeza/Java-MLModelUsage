Grid computing has been widely spread in pragmatic areas and scientific research areas in order to achieve more powerful computation than ordinary computation by single computer. Globus Toolkit4 (GT4), which has been the de facto standard middleware in Grid, gives to us many chances of submitting jobs, especially using WSRF technologies. However, in case of cluster type grid using GT4, rules for job execution depend on a local scheduler (LS) which interacts with WS-GRAM in GT4, so that clients can not reflect their own rules to behaviors in each worker node. In this paper, we formulate those potential problems and solutions based on our proposed architecture in, whose main feature is to monitor resource property (RP) in WS-GRAM and notify its status to worker nodes. Then we describe how to implement a mechanism for monitoring RP in WS-GRAM to achieve the transparent delivery of client's rules to worker nodes. Our experimental results show that our proposed architecture can be incorporated in WS-GRAM without difficulty.

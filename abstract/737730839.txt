PHP is well known as a programming language in the Web 2.0 era enabling agile server-side software development. It has officially supported SOAP messaging since version 5 through a C-based built-in library. In this paper we perform a thorough study of the capability of PHP as a Web service engine in both qualitative and quantitative aspects while comparing it with other Web service engines implemented in Java and C. We used Axis2 for this purpose as it is an open source web service engine whose implementation is available both in Java and C. We report that PHP as a web service engine performs competitively with Axis2 Java for Web services involving small payloads, and greatly outperforms it for larger payloads by 5-17 times. As the authors expected, Axis2 C performs best, but the experimental results demonstrate that PHP performance is closer to Axis2 C with larger payloads. This performance difference comes from the fact that the SOAP engine within the PHP runtime is implemented in C with a monolithic architecture, whereas Axis2 uses a more modular architecture for the flexible insertation of handlers for an assorted set of WS-* standards, and also that Axis2 uses a different data binding mechanism known as ADB (Axis2 Data binding). This paper is the first attempt to compare Web services engines implemented in PHP, Java and C, and the authors believe that this boosts the development of SOAP-based Web services in PHP by letting people know its decent performance score and high productivity characteristics.

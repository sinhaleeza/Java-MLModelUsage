Web services is a fast moving research field with a profound impact to many critical research areas, ranging from software to communication, from server platforms to mobile endpoints. It emerges as a disruptive technology to various enterprises to deliver services, computing, communication and information to their customers and partners. This talk intends to capture some recent advances of Web services and new Web services applications in software-as-a-services, cloud computing, communication, message centric SOAP engine design, and mobile services computing endpoints. In addition to present the technical perspectives and extension potentials in these new developments, I would like to fill the gap between academic research and industry applications through real examples and use cases, with a goal to demonstrate how these technical advances of Web services are applied to industry products and applications, Standards, servers, clients, and new paradigms in software design and testing.

For adapting to the dynamic characteristics of Internet of Things, a dynamic integration mechanism of business process has been proposed. The mechanism realizes redirecting and restructuring of process logic using rules that can be edited at runtime. A dynamic integration algorithm is designed to implement this mechanism. First, the algorithm creates a state transition digraph based on the current rules. Then, it finds a path to meet business objectives according to the current states. Finally, it performs services sequence obtained from the path to complete the business objectives. Our proposed method has a high flexibility, and process logic can easily be redirected according to different requirements.

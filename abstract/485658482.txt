The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of e-services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of e-services and the increasing attacks on them by malicious individuals have highlighted the need for e-service security. The security requirements of an e-service may be specified in an e-service security policy. The provider of the e-service is then responsible for implementing the security measures contained in the policy. However, a service consumer may have security preferences that are not reflected in the provider's e-service security policy (e.g. defense contractors may require higher levels of security). In order for service providers to reach a wider market, a way of customizing a security policy to a particular consumer is needed. We derive the content of an e-service security policy and propose a flexible approach that allows an e-service provider and consumer to negotiate to an agreed-upon e-service security policy. In addition, we examine how our approach may be implemented in a Web services environment and briefly describe the design of our security policy negotiation prototype.

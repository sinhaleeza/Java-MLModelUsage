PROMCODE (PROject Management for COntracted DElivery) is an innovative research consortium to change the way of project management on the resource-oriented services platform. It was launched by Nanzan University and six major Japanese IT companies including Fujitsu, Hitachi, IBM, NEC, Nomura Research Institute, and NTT DATA in May, 2012. Since then, we have developed a common data model to exchange project management data across organizational boundaries along with software supply chains, and supporting service platform to facilitate the data exchange. This article reports on the resource-oriented service model based on a common data model. We also developed a resource-oriented platform for exchanging data based on the OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration), an open standard for tool chain compliant to Web standards, namely RDF/Linked Data and RESTful Web services. To study the feasibility of the developed technologies, we, six companies, conducted intensive experience with real project management data. We discuss the effectiveness of the developed technologies and lessons learned from the experiences.

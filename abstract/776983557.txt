The service selection for automatic dynamic service composition with client's requirements oriented service selection becomes more intense. The existing planning and selection algorithms are mostly designed for service discovery. Further, to our knowledge, there are only a few works that incorporate end-user requirements into service composition. In this paper, we propose a graph based multi-grain clustering and selection model for service composition.

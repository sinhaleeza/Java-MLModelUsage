Abstract-An intelligent scheduling algorithm based on multi-agents and genetic algorithm is proposed to overcome flexible job-shop automation and optimization problems in manufacturing industry. The algorithm is made of a management-agent, a scheduling-agent and machine-agents.Static scheduling is realized by a customized genetic algorithm,while dynamic scheduling is realized by these coordinative agents. Several scenarios are used to illustrate that the proposed system is practical, efficient and advanced.

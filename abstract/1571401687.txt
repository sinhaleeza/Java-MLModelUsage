Web service provides a means to integrate functional components and for business IT solutions in an enterprise or cross-enterprise environment. Enterprise resources are consumed by Web services to provide desired capabilities expected by the users. However, beyond service provisioning, an enterprise needs to manage their Web services and related resources in an optimal manner in order to maximize the resource usage. This paper presents a framework of Web service management aimed for solving the resource allocation issues based on system dynamics models. Our approach combines the business operational consideration and IT infrastructure configuration. Dependency that is derived from impact analysis of different perspectives is an essential part of the model and can be built into control system. The resultant system embodies the capability of autonomic Web service management to certain degree if not fully. The reference architecture of this framework is accounted in this paper. We also demonstrate dynamical behavior of the system through simulation.

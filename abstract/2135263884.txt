We suggest that the composition of Web services is an activity that needs to be managed, and that Web service composition management is distinct from the management of individual Web services. We describe a set of requirements to help make this distinction. The four main groups of these requirements are: service discovery, service selection and contract formation, composition verification, composition management. Then, we discuss architectural alternatives (centralized, federated, and peer-to-peer) for a Web service composition management framework.

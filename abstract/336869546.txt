The growing complexity of software, combined with demands for greater productivity and shorter cycles, creates an increasing demand for more automation and integration within the software engineering (SE) domain. When viewed holistically, the heterogeneous nature, implicit feature cross-dependencies, and manual administration of the toolchain infrastructure results in unnecessary complexity, inefficiencies, and reduced reliability for the SE process. A common infrastructure is missing that provides an interoperable and distributed tool environment, addresses feature dependency selection, and automates toolchain workflow composition and execution. To address these challenges, this paper explores the practicality of a unifying semantic Web services approach towards automated software engineering (SWS-ASE)

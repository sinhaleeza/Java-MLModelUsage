Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud environments expose to users the infrastructure of a data center while relieving them from the burden and costs associated with its management and maintenance. IaaS clouds provide an interface by means of which users can create, configure, and control a set of virtual machines that will typically host a composite software service. Given the increasing popularity of this computing paradigm, previous work has focused on modeling composite software services to automate their deployment in IaaS clouds. This work is concerned with the runtime state of composite services during and after deployment. We propose AESON, a deployment runtime that automatically detects node (virtual machine) failures and eventually brings the composite service to the desired deployment state by using information describing relationships between the service components. We have designed AESON as a decentralized peer-to-peer publish/subscribe system leveraging IBM's Bulletin Board (BB), a topic-based distributed shared memory service built on top of an overlay network.

This paper proposes a document based framework for the modeling of web-based choreographies involving a tight combination of workflow and data management. Our starting point is Active XML proposed by S. Abiteboul - AXML documents are XML documents with embedded service calls. We enhance Active XML with a rich notion of interface and we propose an effective technique to decide if provided services and needs of callers (defined as interfaces) are compatible. We also explicitly take distribution into account and allow for the composition of distributed AXML systems.

Although universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI) is the de jure Web service registry standard, it is not suitable for handling semantic markups due to its flat data model and limited search capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an approach to support semantic service descriptions and queries using registries that conform to the UDDI version 3 specification. Specifically, we present a scheme that allows users to store OWL-S service descriptions in the UDDI data model and use that information to perform semantic query processing. Our approach does not require any modification to the existing UDDI registries. The add-on modules only reside on the client-side machines that wish to take advantage of the semantic capabilities. This approach is completely backward compatible and can integrate seamlessly into the existing service-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure

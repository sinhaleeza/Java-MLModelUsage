For period of time customers have demand for more reusable and manageable service-oriented components for order-to-cash (O2C) solution so they can be easily reconfigured and managed to adapt to business changes quickly. In this paper, we present a service-oriented business process optimization model that minimizes potential revenue leakage through process improvements. We introduce service componentization approach to decompose business processes to identify reusable services in SOA solution context. We adopt Really-Simple-Syndication (RSS) technology to realize a collaborative dispute management solution based on service-oriented architecture (SOA). The proposed approach can help streamline the dispute management process with revenue increase and higher customer satisfaction

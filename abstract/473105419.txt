In service-oriented software development, configuring and composing software services for users according to their personalized requirements become increasingly important. In our previous work, we have proposed a meta-model framework to describe personalized requirements involving domain-related services, based on which we can create domain models to be reused in dealing with personalized requirements. Faced with users' specified requirements, how to select and customize domain models to satisfy both their personalized requirements and domain restrictions remains an important issue. Towards this end, in this paper, we adopt a rule reasoning approach to customize domain goal models using the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). Two kinds of SWRL rules are defined for recommending and verifying users' selected goals. These selected goals can be used to find corresponding processes or services to satisfy users' requirements within our framework. Experiments and implemented prototype show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

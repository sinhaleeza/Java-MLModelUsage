In this paper, we present a realistic but high-level service orchestration model where services are dynamically orchestrated with respect to the mobile behavior of nodes that provide them. We present an intermittence analyze model that monitors and quantifies the mobility of nodes. We present an orchestration model that characterizes the temporal behavior of orchestration specification based on probabilistic measures. We merge two different analysis to decide whether the mobile nodes are appropriate for use for service providing. Our contribution targets mobile computing environments but the proposed approach can be generalized in varying degrees in more traditional dynamic orchestration applications.

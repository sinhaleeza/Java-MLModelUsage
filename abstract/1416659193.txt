Recent advances in the distributed computing infrastructure like Web, grid, and pervasive computing environment accompany demands for a more powerful and autonomous service framework. We believe it is feasible to achieve service discovery and matching in an automated manner and perform the service execution not in restricted environments. For the purpose, we developed an autonomous service framework, called ASF, which allows autonomous service to be published, discovered and executed in distributed environments based on the autonomous service specification, extension of the Web service ontology (OWL-S) to incorporate physical/logical resources and resource policy.

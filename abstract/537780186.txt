The performance of a service's QoS may evolve relatively frequently with its internal changes or the changes of dynamic Internet environment, especially when some"intentional" deceptions are taken into consideration. Therefore, the service providers could not always deliver their services according to their "promised" quality. In view of this challenge, a history record-based service optimization method, named Hire Some, is investigated in this paper. This method aims at enhancing the credibility of service composition plan, taking advantage of a web service's QoShistory records, rather than using the tentative QoS values advertised by the service provider. At last, a case study and an experiment is presented for validating the method.

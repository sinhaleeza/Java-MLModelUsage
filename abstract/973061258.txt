In recent times, automated business processes and web services have become ubiquitous in diverse application spaces. Efficient composition of web services in real time while providing necessary QoS guarantees is a computationally complex problem and several heuristic based approaches have been proposed to compose services optimally. In this paper, we present the design of a scalable but approximate QoS-aware service composition mechanism which balances the computational complexity of service composition with the QoS guarantees of the composed service and achieves scalability for dynamic service composition. We present experimental results to show the efficiency of our proposed mechanism.

We present an overall framework of services for indoor navigation, which includes Indoor Mapping, Indoor Positioning, Path Planning, and En-route Assistance. Within such framework we focus on an augmented reality (AR) solution for en-route assistance. AR assists the user walking in a multi-floor building by displaying a directional arrow under a camera view, thus freeing the user from knowing his/her position. Our AR solution relies on geomagnetic positioning and north-oriented space coordinates transformation. Therefore, it can work without infrastructure and without relying on GPS. The AR visual interface and the integration with magnetic positioning is the main novelty of our solution, which has been validated by experiments and shows a good performance.

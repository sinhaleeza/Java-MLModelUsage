The files to be transferred should be specified by the URLs, it is not convenient for users to get the wanted file through fragmentary file related information and lack efficient ways to search where the file is. Here proposed an intelligent data transferring system (IDTS) based on semantic Web services, modeling data transferring functions as semantic Web services by OWL-S, and register the services by UDDI. We map service profile into UDDI records for performing semantic matching. The IDTS use semantic Web services to fulfill automatic discovery, execution, and composition and interoperation of data transfer services.

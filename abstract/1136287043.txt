EAI and SOA are widely adopted in enterprise information systems with business processes being orchestrated by a process engine. An algorithm which schedules tasks of process instances to maximize overall customer satisfaction is proposed in this paper. This new algorithm maximizes the total value of all process instances by dynamically assigning different priority to each task based on the business value and time-left of the corresponding process instances. The value of each kind of process instance is modeled as a utility function of response time which reflects the inverse proportional relationship between the customer satisfaction and response time. Experiments show that the total value of utility function with the proposed algorithm is promoted a lot than traditional methods.

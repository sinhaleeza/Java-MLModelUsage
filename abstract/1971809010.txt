This paper introduces a middleware for time independent mobile Web services (Mob-WS) that avoids the overheads of long durational synchronous communication. Details of communication architecture and interaction among the middleware components is presented and discussed. The Bluetooth binding for SOAP has been developed and briefly presented.

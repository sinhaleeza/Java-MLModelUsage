Service optimization and energy conservation requires a thorough understanding of the performance impact of different hardware configurations. In this paper we focus on the configuration of memory and investigate the impact of memory dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) on the performance of services/applications. We propose a quantitative metric called frequency sensitivity (FS) and study memory FS of various benchmarks. Our experiments yield several insights for memory DVFS based performance tuning.

The cost and effort for developing personal healthcare systems with IoT devices can be substantially high mainly due to complex inference capabilities. To tackle the problems, we proposed INFerence-as-a-Service (INFaaS) in our previous work. INFaaS is a cloud service which provides a core set of common functionality required to develop various context-aware applications. Since INFaaS is designed for generic purpose, its applicability and genericity should be verified in that sense. In this paper, we present a comprehensive case study of developing an IoT-based Personal Healthcare System with the INFaaS cloud framework. This system requires various inference algorithms to diagnose diseases with the acquired medical contexts, which will increase developers' overhead. We believe that a cloud service providing inference services such as INFaaS yields a tremendous benefits in terms of cost benefits.

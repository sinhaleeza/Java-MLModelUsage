In this paper, we present SAWSDL-MX2, a hybrid semantic Web service matchmaker for SAWSDL services. Building on our initial work, we adopt logic-based as well as text similarity service selection for model references and add a structural approach, which operates on the pure syntactic description of WSDL elements. The integration of these matching variants is accomplished using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with non-linear kernel, thus automatically adapting an aggregation function based on previously experienced training data. Results of our performance evaluation based on the standard measures recall and precision over the SAWSDL-TC1 test collection as well as an exhaustive example for all basic matching variants are also given.

The behavioral analysis for Web services provides a priori detection of errors to ensure successful interactions in services invocation and composition, and the behavioral substitution of Web services is one of the most important issues in such analysis. In this paper, we propose to formalize the behavior of a Web service by π-calculus. Based on the formalization, we introduce two notions of behavioral substitution of Web services namely strong and weak simulation. Furthermore, we propose a derivative approach to analyzing the behavioral substitution of services according to the given notions, which is implemented based on an existing tool of π-calculus. The proposed approach takes advantage of formalization and theory of π-calculus, so that the formalized services can be naturally analyzed and the behavioral substitution of them can be easily determined.

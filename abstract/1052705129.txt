Grid monitoring covers two separate areas: application monitoring and infrastructure monitoring. Infrastructure monitoring is different from application monitoring because it puts emphases on testing components in grid environment such as grid middleware (gatekeeper, index service, GridFtp, etc.) and grid services. Testbed Status Monitoring Tool (GTSM) in GridLab provides a reliable information service - Monitoring service, but it is a central architecture and a single failure in key site hosting Monitoring service may bring about inestimable losses. In this paper, a more flexible architecture named WormTest is provided (our inspiration for novel mechanisms of the spread of a worm network comes from living systems), which is aimed to solve the limitations brought by central testing.

Operation services are reusable and shareable units of configuration code executed by configuration management tools (CMTs), achieving continuous deployment and continuous delivery. With the prevalence of DevOps (Development and Operations), thousands of operation services have been developed for various software systems, and they are publicly available through the online repositories of popular CMTs. However, locating and retrieving desired operation services is challenging since keyword-and tag-based search provided by a repository is with low precision. In this paper, we implement a hierarchical categorization approach based search service, named OSFinder, which searches and locates desired operation services more accurately. OSFinder first constructs a category hierarchy for operation services across multiple repositories, and then it classifies over 13,000 operation services into 90 categories based on machine learning technique, finally it provides a search for users. With OSFinder, a user can narrow down his search scope by tracking the category hierarchy in a top-down way, and then searches in a small group with keywords. The evaluation shows that OSFinder outperforms keyword-and tag-based search.

Service-oriented environments facilitate dynamic processes whose properties can be altered during runtime. The transactional support of such processes holds specific requirements that are not completely covered by existing specifications. In this paper, we introduce a life cycle model for transactional dynamic processes and analyze existing specifications with respect to their potentials to support such a model. Subsequently, we propose a framework resolving the weaknesses of existing specifications and allowing comprehensive transactional coordination of dynamic processes.

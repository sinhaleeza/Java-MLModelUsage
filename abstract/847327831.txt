Survivability is crucial for computer systems that support critical infrastructures of our society. For those in paradigm of SOA where the computing settings are intrinsically open, traditional survivability model and safeguard mechanisms are no longer applicable. To rise to the challenge, we propose a formal definition and a corresponding framework to evaluate the survivability of SOA systems. We treat survivability as a multidimensional QoS property, and then give a holistic evaluation method based on the Hidden Markov Model.

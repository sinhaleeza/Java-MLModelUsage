Web Services providing access to datasources with structured data have an important place in the SOA. In this paper we focus on modeling and discovery of generic data providing services (DPS), with the goal of making data providing services available for interactions with service requesters in contexts such as service composition and mediation. In our model RDF Views are used to represent the content provided by the DPS. A characterization of match between description of DPS as RDF Views and the OWL-S service request is specified, based on which we developed a flexible matchmaking algorithm for discovery of data providing services. Finally, we propose a realization of the DPS using a SOAP version of the SPARQL protocol and a dynamic configuration interface allowing easy interactions of service requesters with data providing services.

As a traditional algorithm, the string match meets a challenge with the development of the massive volume of data because of gene sequencing. Surveys show that there will be a huge amount of short read segments during the process of gene sequencing and the need for a highly efficient is urgent. The BWA is an effective algorithm to deal with the short read mapping. Compared with other short read mapping algorithms, the BWA algorithm has a smaller size, and this does not influence its effect. However, there is still not a system is used to accelerate the BWA algorithm especially. Thus we decide to build a system to expedite the algorithm and make it satisfied with the application of gene sequencing. In this paper, we present genome sequencing services on scalable energy-efficient accelerators. Especially, we first introduce the BWA algorithm and claim the reason for the choice of the algorithm. Then, we implement an accelerator based on FPGA to improve the performance of the algorithm. Compared to the other major platforms in accelerating the algorithm, we discuss the advantages of the FPGA platform and the limit of the other platform. Last, we build our hardware platform with a Xilinx ZYNQ FPGA development board, and the result shows that our accelerator can achieve a promising speedup and resource utilization and make it balanced between power and cost.

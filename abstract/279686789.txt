The goal of Web service effort is to achieve universal interoperability between applications by using Web standards: this emergent technology is a promising way to integrate business applications. A business process can then be seen as a set of Web services that could belong to different companies and interact with each other by sending messages. In that context, neither a global model nor a global mechanism is available to monitor and trace faults when the business process fails. In this paper, we address this issue and propose to use model-based reasoning approaches on discrete-event systems (DES). This paper presents an automatic method to model Web service behaviors and their interactions as a set of synchronized discrete-event systems. This modeling is the first step before tracing the evolution of the business process and diagnosing business process faults.

In the wireless world there has been much interest in alternate serialization formats for XML data, mostly driven by the weak capabilities of both devices and networks. However, an alternate serialization format is not easily made compatible with XML security features such as encryption and signing. We consider here ways to integrate an alternate format with security, and present a solution that we see as a viable alternative. In addition to this, we present extensive performance measurements, including ones on a mobile phone, on the effect of an alternate format when using XML-based security. These measurements indicate that, in the wireless world, reducing message sizes is the most pressing concern, and that processing efficiency gains of an alternate format are a much lesser concern

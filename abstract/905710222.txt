Service-oriented collective intelligence, which creates new value by combining services provided by various organizations via services computing technologies, has been gaining in importance with the development of services computing technologies. Because collective intelligence needs many participants, it is crucial to build a framework where a wide variety of policies of service providers are satisfied. In this paper, we propose an architecture which handles a comprehensive process of service selection, adaptation, and coordination to satisfy policies of service providers. First the system selects services, and then adapts the services to the given policies if any of available services cannot satisfy the policies. To achieve this, we formalized this problem as an extension of constraint satisfaction problem and showed a solution. Moreover, the system often needs to force a composite service to follow protocols given by service providers. Therefore we proposed a method which uses meta-level control functions for composite services in order to change order of service execution.

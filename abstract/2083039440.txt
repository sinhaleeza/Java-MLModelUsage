Web services availability has been regarded as one of the key properties for (critical) service-oriented applications. Based on analyzing the limitations of current metrics for "User-perceived" availability, we propose a service status based availability metric and a corresponding estimating approach. Experiments demonstrate that this metric and the corresponding estimation approach could get reasonable measurement on web services' availability.

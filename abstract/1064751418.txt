In service-based systems, one of the most basic requirements for service matching is to find services with functionalities similar to the expected functionality of a given service discovery request. In this paper, a functionality-compatibility-based service indexing and matching approach is presented. This approach indexes a set of services using functionality-compatibility defined on their parameters and conditions, and filters the indexed services to identify those with compatible functionalities to the service discovery request efficiently. This approach is evaluated to show the effectiveness and efficiency.

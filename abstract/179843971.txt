In the near future, Industrial Internet of Things can provide various useful spatial information in urban areas. Based on real time resource discovery and data retrieval technologies, mobile devices can continuously interact with surrounding things and provide real time content mash up services to their users. One challenge involved in such a scenario falls in the resource management. Continuous resource discovery and content mash up processes can be resource intensive for common handheld mobile devices. In order to reduce the resource usage, certain tasks of mobile application can be offloaded to Utility Cloud services. However, the task offloading process needs to be context-aware. In certain cases, performing tasks in mobile devices is more cost-efficient. This paper proposes a service-oriented workflow based mobile Cloud middleware framework for balancing the task allocation between the mobile terminal and utility Cloud service. The proposed cost-performance index scheme assists workflow configuration decision-making based on fuzzy set and weight of context schemes. The prototype has been implemented in real mobile devices and the evaluation has shown that the workflow system can automatically configure the task allocation based on resource availabilities.

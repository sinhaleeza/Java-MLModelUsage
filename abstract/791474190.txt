In order to adapt to the inconstancy of business environments and service requirements, the framework of service-oriented product line development is proposed, which is used to analyze, verify and implement dynamic processes and process changes automatically. In this paper, we present a logical feature model which can model the variability of requirements, and introduce variant points in business process templates defined by petri nets to model dynamic processes. Then, we map compound features in a logical feature model to variant points in a template through propositional logics. At last, the configured process can be verified based on petri net theory.

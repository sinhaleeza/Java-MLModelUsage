An aggregated privacy-preserving identity verification scheme is proposed for composite Web services. It aggregates multiple component providers' interactions of identity verification to a single one involving the user. Besides, it protects users from privacy disclosure through the adoption of zero-knowledge of proof of knowledge. This approach can dramatically reduce the computation time, independently on the number of identity attributes and component providers.

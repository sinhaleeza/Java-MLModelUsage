Providing non interrupted Web Services from resource limited mobile devices needs to be done in a rather light-weight manner. Processing and communication will drain the battery rapidly, hence, both should be kept at a minimum. This paper describes the outcomes of an investigation into simple offloading mechanisms that facilitate provision of adaptive and distributed Restful mobile web services from resource constrained mobile devices. Offloading considers the distributed hosts processing as well as communication capabilities. Using queuing theory, the performance gained from distributing mobile web service tasks is explored. In addition, the theoretical boundaries of different flavours of offloading mechanisms are presented. The analytical, as well as the experimental results show the differences in performance between these mechanisms.

This work aims to advance Web Service retrieval, also known as Matching, in two directions. First, it introduces a matching algorithm for SAWSDL, which adapts and extends known concepts with novel strategies. Effective logic-based and syntactic strategies are introduced and combined in a novel hybrid strategy, targeting an envisioned well-defined, real-world scenario for matching. The algorithm is evaluated in a universal environment for matching algorithms, SME2, in an objective, reproducible manner. Evaluation ranks Tomaco high amongst state of the art, especially for early recall levels (first in macro-averaging precision, up to 0.7 recall). Secondly, this work introduces the Tomaco web application, which aims to promote wide-spread adoption of Semantic Web Services while targeting the lack of user-friendly applications in this field, by integrating a variety of configurable matching algorithms proposed in this paper. It, finally, allows discovery of both existing and user-contributed service collections and ontologies, serving also as a service registry.

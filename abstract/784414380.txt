Automated matching of service descriptions is the key to service discovery and composition. In this paper, we propose an approach for web services discovery and composition. The approach relies on (1) SAWSDL, a simple and generic annotation language, (2) an XML representation of a web service that carries both syntactic (e.g., WSDL) and semantic (e.g., SAWSDL) information, and (3) the reuse of available schema matchers. The approach departs from exiting ones because it does not advocate a specific matchmaking algorithm, and it promotes the combination of different schema matchers, allowing multiple discovery and composition strategies.

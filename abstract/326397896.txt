The specification, design and implementation of web service applications need to address three major aspects: Orchestration of Services, Conversation and Choreography. In distributed computing, abstractions such as scripts have been used to abstract patterns of communication hiding low level details. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach of integrating orchestration with scripting to depict a pattern of communication or conversations among various agents.

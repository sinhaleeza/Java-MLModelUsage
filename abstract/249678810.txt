Service reuse aims at improving the efficiency of software development and providing common functionalities which are not linked to any particular business process. However, the existing service reuse methods are confined to the reuse of atomic services or processes encapsulated as stand-alone services. How to reuse arbitrary granularities of Service Process Fragment (SPF) is a challenging problem with great application value. This paper presents a novel Variable Granularities Index (VGI) based on SSM-Tree on service processes. VGI could realize the unified index on both atomic and composite services and maximize reuse of them. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness, we construct a sample dataset which contains 500 thousand processes and 127 million atomic services based on the Web Service Challenge Testset Generator (CTG). The experimental results show an effective and efficient approach for SPF query.

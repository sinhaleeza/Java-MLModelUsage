In this paper we enhance the mediation approach for interoperability in dynamic manufacturing networks (DMN) by decreasing the number of iterations that should be performed in order to find the right adaptation function between an expected message and the incoming ones. Then, we define a deployment architecture for mediators in dynamic collaboration environments that better handles the changes that could occur at run-time. We then conduct a set of experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of the introduced approach and architecture.

In Big Data era, continuous data with low latency and high throughput makes high-availability essential for stream computing. Traditional availability guarantee is tightly-coupled and inefficient for customization and reuse. In this paper, a framework is proposed to improve the availability of stream computing, in which basic functions are provided as general services like reliable point-to-point communication and distributed status management. With its help, high-level patterns can be achieved effectively. Comprehensive experiments have been designed and evaluated to show the availability improvement with acceptable extra overheads.

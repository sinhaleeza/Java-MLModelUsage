Among the approaches that investigate the similarity between web services, hardly any concentrates on the impacts from contexts. In this paper we introduce service2vec which is an approach to represent web services as service embeddings based on a recent popular deep learning technique word2vec. Our approach composes and combines web services to be a document that is trained by the modeling technique of word2vec. As a result, each web service in the document is vectorized. By taking the advantage of word2vec, the resulting service embeddings of service2vec can be used to illustrate the contextual relations between web services. The experimental results suggest that service2vec can deliver contextual similarity between web services.

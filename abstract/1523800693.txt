Recent developments in daily business life indicate demand for facilitating process execution on various environments, including mobile devices with limited capabilities. This paper summarizes our current research on extending service oriented architecture to lightweight mobile devices. Status of necessary enabling technologies, programming interfaces, and the supporting device base was surveyed. Availability of both mobile consumption and provision of services are reviewed. Based on our research and concept demonstration, we conclude that full-fledged mobile participation in SOA is not far in the future, and that partial implementations can already be built.

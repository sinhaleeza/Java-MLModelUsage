With the unprecedented and dramatic development of Web services in recent years, designing novel approaches for efficient Web service prediction has become of paramount importance. Quality of Service (QoS) plays a critical role in Web service recommendation. However determining QoS values of Web services is still a challenging task. For example, some QoS properties (e.g., response time, throughput) may hold different values for different users. In this paper, we describe how to develop a novel approach, PLMwsp, based on a probabilistic latent model, to predict effectively the QoS values of Web services. A Web service prediction has been developed, and experiments have been conducted to show the efficacy of our approach.

In SOA, services may become volatile and fail to deliver the quality of service as requested by users. In this paper, we present an approach for repairing failed services by replacing them with new services and ensuring the new service process still meets the user specified end-to-end QoS constraints. An iterative structural inspection algorithm is designed to produce reconfiguration regions that include one or more failed service. By reconfiguring only services in the selected regions, the business process will not be affected significantly. The algorithm may also utilize those available QoS constraints to relax the original constraints of a reconfiguration region and to provide more effective reconfiguration solutions. We also present the middleware components to support the service reconfiguration in the LLAMA framework.

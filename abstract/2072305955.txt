The Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) provides a standard graphical language that can be used by business analysts for modeling business process choreographies. A challenging task is to formally verify that constructed choreography models are logically correct with respect to safety, liveness, and various application-specific correctness requirements. To aid with this important task, we present a model checker based framework to automate the verification process. The main component of our framework is the BPMN verifier, a tool that can automatically convert BPMN choreography models into PROMELA, the input language of the SPIN model checker. We describe the implementation and functionality of the BPMN verifier, and how the tool eases the task of expressing Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) correctness requirements, through its LTL Manager component.

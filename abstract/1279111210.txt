In this tutorial, we present the results of abstracting a reference architecture for SOA based on multiple projects during the past 6 years. As an example SOA Solution Reference Architecture, the SOA Solution Stack (S3) defines the layers, architectural building blocks, design decisions, patterns, options and architectural decisions and the separation of concerns needed to model, architect, assemble, deploy and manage an end-to-end solution in the context of a service-oriented approach. The SOA Solution Stack (a.k.a. Service-oriented Solution Stack) provides a blue print for an enterprise or application architecture scope. The SOA Solution Stack is based on establishing the building blocks of SOA: services, components and flows that collectively support business processes and goals. The meta-data underlying each layer and relationship between layers can further facilitate SOA in bridging the gap between business and IT from solution modeling to solution realization.

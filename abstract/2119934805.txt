Outsource encrypted data is a popular trend for storing sensitive data in third party clouds. Many cloud applications need privacy preserving data encryption services with two capabilities: On one hand, they need querying over encrypted data in Web based data hosting services. On the other hand, they also need to keep the query keywords and associated search operations private such that data hosting service providers cannot gain access to unauthorized content or trace and infer sensitive data stored in the third party data hosting servers. In this paper we present a novel service oriented framework for verifiable searchable asymmetric encryption, called PVSAE. PVSAE offers strong support for outsourced encrypted data with two formal security properties in terms of IND-CKA security and search pattern privacy. Our framework supports two concrete PVSAE schemes. The first scheme l-PVSAE is based on the l-dimensional vectors and achieves strong security notions, namely statistical IND-CKA security and statistical search pattern privacy. The second scheme 3-PVSAE is a light-weight version based on 3-dimensional vectors. 3-PVSAE maintains the strong security properties and offers higher efficiency for search over encrypted data compared with existing verifiable searchable asymmetric encryption schemes. We experimentally evaluate the proposed PVSAE schemes and show that they not only offer strong security but also are practical and deployable.

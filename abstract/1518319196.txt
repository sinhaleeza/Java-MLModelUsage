Pervasive computing environments are nowadays more and more used as a supporting tool for cooperative workflows, e.g., in emergency management. A typical problem in these scenarios is the synthesis of workflows in presence of sets of services (hosted on mobile devices) with constrained behaviors, just before the collaborating team is dropped off in the operation field. In this paper, we propose a technique able to automatically synthesize distributed orchestrators, each one coordinating a service and synchronizing with the other orchestrators, given a target generic workflow to be carried out and a set of behaviorally-constrained services.

A generalized declarative constraint framework is proposed in this paper to address challenges of applying constraints to model-driven SOA deployment and configuration. By representing deployment metamodel and domain knowledge as patterns, constraints can be easily described, automatically validated and analyzed. This framework reduces the human-intensiveness and error-proneness in the activity of applying constraints to a SOA deployment topology. We implemented this framework over a model-driven SOA deployment platform leveraging OCL as the declarative constraint language, and verified it in industry deployment scenarios.

REST Chart is a Petri-Net based XML modeling framework for REST API. This paper presents two important enhancements and extensions to REST Chart modeling - Hyperlink Decoration and Hierarchical REST Chart. In particular, the proposed Hyperlink Decoration decomposes resource connections from resource representation, such that hyperlinks can be defined independently of schemas. This allows a Navigation-First Design by which the important global connections of a REST API can be designed first and reused before the local resource representations are implemented and specified. Hierarchical REST Chart is a powerful mechanism to rapidly decompose and extend a REST API in several dimensions based on Hyperlink Decoration. These new mechanisms can be used to manage the complexities in large scale REST APIs that undergo frequent changes as in some large scale open source development projects. This paper shows that these new capabilities can fit nicely in the REST Chart XML with very minor syntax changes. These enhancements to REST Chart are applied successfully in designing and verifying REST APIs for software-defined-networking (SDN) and Cloud computing.

Web Services Description Language (WSDL) allows a structured way to standardize the description of Web Services, exploiting XML for the exchange of structured information. Nevertheless XML supports little interoperability between services, expected when WSDL documents have to be combined. In this context, the Semantic Web has become a promising research field. Semantic Models (e.g. RDF or OWL) allow knowledge from many different sources to be easily combined so that unexpected data connections can be used. In this paper we provide a description of WSDL documents into a metamodel representation of Semantic Models. It allows interoperability at different levels of abstraction. A Datalog rule based system queries both service description and associated semantic annotations. Such system is built on top of traditional database technology to guarantee an efficient management of Semantic Web Services Descriptions. Finally we present experiments on a real dataset to test the feasibility of the modeling approach.

QoS has become an important measure for web service selection. In this paper, we present an approach which can provide the approximate QoS value for users, and support finding the optimal web service. Firstly, it clusters the users based on location and network condition, then according to the QoS historical statistics of users in the same cluster, uses the linear regression algorithm to predict the QoS value based on invocation time and workload.

Nowadays, executions of composite Web services are typically conducted by heavyweight centralized engines. A centralized is a potential processing and communication bottleneck as well as a central point of failure, and its cost of deployment is usually too high for a large number of small businesses or end-users. In addition, it presents some weaknesses dealing with privacy issues. These drawbacks, and requirements such as loose coupling, are pushing service infrastructures toward more decentralized and dynamic interaction schemes. In this paper, we propose a decentralized alternative system for the execution of composite Web services based on the chemical analogy. The chemical paradigm provides a high-level execution model that allows executing composite services in a fully decentralized manner. Our architecture is composed by nodes communicating through a shared space containing both control and data flows, allowing to distribute the composition among nodes without the need for any centralized coordination.

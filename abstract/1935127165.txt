Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are increasingly mounted by cyber-criminal gangs to extort money from online businesses. This kind of attacks is normally targeted at a particular service provider to exhaust the network and system resources of the provider. Since the scale of the attack is limited, the ISP operators normally cannot observe this type of attacks. As a result, the victim of the attack is left to deal with the attack on its own accord. This paper proposes a SOA approach to build a system against DDoS attacks targeting online businesses. The system is built on Web services. It can be constructed and reconfigured easily by an attack victim. Experiments were also carried out to measure the overheads and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

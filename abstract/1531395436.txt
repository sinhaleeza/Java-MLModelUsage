Web services (WS) technology is becoming pervasive in the development of distributed systems and is an appealing vehicle for service presentation and horizontal integration. On the other hand, model integrated computing (MIC) offers a means of system integration in the vertical direction by using domain-specific modeling, and then synthesizing the software system from the high-level model using a model-specific generator. This paper presents a meta-modeling approach to WS to explore the application of MIC in WS development and its contribution.

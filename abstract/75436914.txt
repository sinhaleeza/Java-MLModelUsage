QoS-aware Web service composition has recently become one of the most challenging research issues. Although much work has been investigated to solve the problem, they mainly focus on certain QoS of Web services, while QoS with uncertainty exposes the most important characteristic in a real and highly dynamic environment on the Internet. In this paper, with the consideration of uncertain service QoS, we model the issue of Web service composition with QoS uncertainty that is translated into a multi-objective optimization problem via uncertain interval number, which can be solved by our proposed approach via an non-deterministic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using the strategy of decomposition. Large-scale empirical experiments have been conducted on our simulated datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively and efficiently find an optimum composite service solution set with satisfactory convergence.

Design defects are symptoms of poor design and implementation solutions adopted by developers during the development of their software systems. While the research community devoted a lot of effort to studying and devising approaches for detecting the traditional design defects in object-oriented (OO) applications, little knowledge and support is available for an emerging category of Web service interface design defects. Indeed, it has been shown that service designers and developers tend to pay little attention to their service interfaces design. Such design defects can be subjectively interpreted and hence detected in different ways. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named WS3D, using machine learning techniques that combines Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Simulated Annealing (SA) to learn from real world examples of service design defects. WS3D has been empirically evaluated on a benchmark of Web services from 14 different application domains. We compared WS3D with the state-of-theart approaches which rely on traditional declarative techniques to detect service design defects by combining metrics and threshold values. Results show that WS3D outperforms the the compared approaches in terms of accuracy with a precision and recall scores of 91% and 94%, respectively.

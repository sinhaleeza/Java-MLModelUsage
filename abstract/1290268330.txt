Reverse geocoding has raised potential privacy concerns, especially regarding the ability to reverse engineer geographical location to obtain the street address of an individual. In most cases, direct reference to the geography of the area mapped that elucidates sensitive information isn't of much interest than having the knowledge of what we can do or find there. Rather than raising a flag, this paper presents a design framework of the space profile-based reverse geocoding service that creates an abstract space which explains area characteristic and can be used to infer probable activities that individuals can be engaged in the area.

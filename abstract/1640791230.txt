In order to make a composite web service meet user's response-time requirement, the proper instance of each member web service should be selected and bound. In the literature, all the member web services of a composite web service are treated equally during the response-time management, but without considering their different capabilities of effecting the user's satisfaction. However, in a certain using scenario, some member services are more sensitive than others, that is to say, in a given composite web service, if these sensitive services delayed, the decline of users' satisfaction is remarkably greater than that when other services delayed. In this article, a using scenario oriented response-time management method is proposed to reduce the delaying risk of the time sensitive web services, and thus to improve the user's satisfaction of a composite web service. Our experiments validated the efficiency of the proposed method.

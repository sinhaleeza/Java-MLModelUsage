In view of complex battlefield environment and technological factors, unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV) decision-making cannot accurately reflect battlefield situation and make reasonable decisions by itself. To solve this problem, this paper presents a limited intervention collaborative decision-making mechanism between manned aerial vehicle(MAV) and UAV based on visualising fuzzy cognitive map (VFCM). By use of limited intervention trigger strategy, high efficiency and feasibility of decision-making can be ensured. Simulation indicates that limited intervention collaborative decision making of the MAV/UAV team is reasonable and feasible.

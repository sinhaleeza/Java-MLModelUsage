Web services promise to allow businesses to adapt rapidly to changes in the business environment, and the needs of different customers. However, the rapid introduction of new services paired with the dynamicity of the business environment also leads to undesirable interactions that negatively impact service quality and user satisfaction. In this paper, we propose an approach for modeling such undesirable interactions as feature interactions. Our approach for detecting interactions is based on goal-oriented analysis and scenario modeling. It allows us to reason about feature interactions in terms of goal conflicts, and feature deployment. Two case studies illustrate the approach. The paper concludes with a discussion, and an outlook on future research.

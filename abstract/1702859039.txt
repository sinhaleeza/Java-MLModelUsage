We present an approach to the inference of automata models of Web-based business applications using only execution traces recording the externally observable behavior of such applications. The proposed approach yields behavioral models representing both the control flow of an application and the data variations corresponding to different types of users. We also describe how the obtained models allow the use of verification techniques like model checking in the validation phase using a case study featuring a travel reservation agency.

WS-coordination and WS-CF provide support for distributed activities that require coordination in an environment of Web services. Both specifications are generic coordination frameworks, not specific for any application. Despite their generic character, up to now only transactional protocols have been defined, which leverage these coordination frameworks. In this work we map a distributed activity, that it is not related to transactions, onto the coordination model underlying WS-coordination and WS-CF. Consequently we identify the necessary characteristics of a distributed activity that leverages the coordination frameworks of WS-coordination and WS-CF. We also examine limits of these coordination frameworks and suggest additional mechanisms where support for coordination in particular use cases is not sufficient. In contrast to coordinating distributed transactions, additional problems could arise when other types of activities are subject to coordination. These problems are studied, classified and reviewed in conjunction with the architectural differences of WS-coordination and WS-CF.

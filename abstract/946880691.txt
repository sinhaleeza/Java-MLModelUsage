The challenge of optimally selecting services from a set of functionally appropriate ones under Quality of Service (QoS) constraints -- the Service Selection Problem -- has been extensively addressed in the literature based on deterministic parameters. In practice, however, Quality of Service QoS parameters rather follow a stochastic distribution. In the work at hand, we present an integrated approach which addresses the Service Selection Problem for complex workflows in conjunction with stochastic Quality of Service parameters. Accounting for penalty cost which accrue due to Quality of Service violations, our approach reduces the impact of stochastic QoS behavior on total cost significantly.

Despite the benefits those communities FM radio broadcasting services provide to their listeners, more than half of the community stations in Japan are struggling financially. This situation has arisen because the Internet has attracted advertising revenue away from radio broadcasting channels. One way to revive local FM radio broadcasting is by adding new representation function to radio signals. It is designed for many listeners to share the same information simultaneously. On the other hand, while the Web provides a variety of content, its ability to broadcast is inferior to that of TV or radio broadcasting. Combining radio broadcasting and the WWW provides a new broadcasting media. The control signals used for accessing the Web are put onto radio sound by using Acoustic OFDM technology. We developed and evaluated such a broadcasting system.

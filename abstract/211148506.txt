Composition of Web Services (WS) into business processes (BP) often results in occurrence of defects in a process: implicit dependencies, incorrect contexts, non-optimal or bottlenecked workflow, and deadlocks. To deal with these problems, WS Mining (process mining in SOA) research provides methods and tools to discover, evaluate and enhance real world processes basing on a process model discovered from a log. Unfortunately, current research in this field only concerns SOAP-WS which are not as well-suited as RESTful-WS in the context of current research trends like Internet of Things or Web 2.0. WS Mining methods and tools should consider RESTful-WS where functionality of the system is expressed in the form of resources and relationships among them. In this paper we show the idea of discovering process models for interacting RESTful-WS with respect to both workflow and resources perspectives. We introduce extended version of the Î± algorithm (AA), RESTful-WS mining algorithm (RMA), which discovers hierarchical process models and resource-oriented perspective of a process including local and global behavior. Finally, we present a brief discussion on how RMA decomposes a problem into smaller ones, significantly reducing the execution time in real time scenarios.

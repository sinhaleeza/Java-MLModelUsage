Runtime monitoring of Web service compositions has been widely acknowledged as a significant approach to understand and guarantee the quality of services. However, existing runtime monitoring solutions consider only the constraints on the sequence of messages exchanged between partner services and ignore the actual data contents inside the messages. As a result, it is difficult to monitor some dynamic properties such as how message data of interest is processed between different participants. To address this issue, we propose an efficient, non-intrusive online monitoring approach to dynamically analyze data-centric properties for service-oriented applications involving multiple participants. By introducing Par-BCL - a Parametric Behavior Constraint Language for web services - to define monitoring parameters, various data-centric temporal behavior properties for Web services can be specified and monitored. This approach broadens the monitored patterns to include not only message exchange orders, but also the data contents bound to the parameters. To reduce runtime overhead, we statically analyze the monitored properties to generate parameter state machine from the event pattern automata to optimize monitoring. The experiments show that our solution is efficient and promising.

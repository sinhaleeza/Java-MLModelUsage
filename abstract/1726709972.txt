The objective of the MASSIVE project is to build a grid platform to enable large-scale and distributed scientific and engineering computations. Its focus is numerical simulation and visualization. This paper addresses a prototype grid utilizing resources at the Center for Engineering and Scientific Computation (CESC) in Zhejiang University (ZJU). This grid is capable of taking a model geometry generated by CAD systems, transferring it to an SGI Onyx 3900 supercomputer where it is meshed. The meshed geometry is then transferred to a Dawning PC cluster where it is used to solve computational fluid dynamics and computational solid mechanics problems and it is finally visualized showing numerical results.

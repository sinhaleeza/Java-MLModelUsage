This work presents the use of security proposals in the Web Services architecture aiming to provide an environment that guarantees authentication and authorization transfer between different security domains. The model described facilitates the access of rights owners into an environment with different security technologies. This model is based on the federation Web concept, which allows scalable and flexible rights management solutions. This work illustrates the model properties through examples involving different security technologies.

In spite of the enormous attention that automated service composition has attracted in the recent past, and the large number of approaches that has been developed, these approaches are rarely put into practice and deployed for real-world problems. In light of the increasing demand for an automated construction of services in various domains, this is a somewhat surprising observation. In fact, in domains such as automated machine learning and cloud gaming, both users and providers of software are highly interested in running services that are created in an on-the-fly manner. This paper presents PROSECO, a framework that aims at closing this gap by creating running services from simple queries specifiable by end-users relying on predefined prototypes. To show the applicability of PROSECO, we instantiated it for three highly heterogeneous domains: automated machine learning, cloud gaming, and information integration.

One of the key problems that should be solved is the collision between tags which lowers the efficiency of the RFID system. The existed popular anti-collision algorithms are ALOHA-type algorithms and QT. But these methods show good performance when the number of tags to read is small and not dynamic. However, when the number of tags to read is large and dynamic, the efficiency of recognition is very low. A novel approach to mapped correlation of ID for RFID anti-collision has been proposed to solve the problem in this paper. This method can increase the association between tags so that tags can send their own ID under certain trigger conditions, by mapped correlation of ID, querying on multi-tree becomes more efficient. In the case of not too big number of tags, by replacing the actual ID with the temporary ID, the method can greatly reduce the number of times that the reader reads and writes to tag's ID. In the case of dynamic ALOHA-type applications, the reader can determine the locations of the empty slots according to the position of the binary pulse, so it can avoid the decrease in efficiency which is caused by reading empty slots when reading slots. Experiments have shown this method can greatly improve the recognition efficiency of the system.

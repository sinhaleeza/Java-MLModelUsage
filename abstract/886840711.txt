Cloud Computing is radically changing the way of providing and managing IT services. Big enterprises are continuously investing on Cloud technologies to streamline IT processes and substantially reduce the time to market of new services. The current Cloud service model enables companies, with a low initial investment, to easily test new services and technologies, like IoT and Big Data, on a "ready to go" virtualized infrastructure. However, large organizations are still facing multiple challenges in migrating business-critical services and sensitive data to Public Cloud environments. To investigate the current adoption of Public Cloud services, we interviewed IT managers and cloud architects of over sixty multinational organizations. The survey assesses both business and technical issues and requirements of current and future Cloud strategies. Our analysis shows that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are not yet perceived as fully able to address critical points in security, regulatory constraints and performance management. Hence, to control their public cloud services and to overcome such limitations, multinational organizations must adopt structured SLM approaches.

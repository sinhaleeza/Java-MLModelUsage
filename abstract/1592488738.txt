Web services simplify enterprise application integration by facilitating reuse of existing components for creating new services. In a dynamic environment, it is imperative to design a Web service composition and execution (WSCE) system that adapts to failure of component services or changes in their QoS offerings. In this paper, we motivate a staged approach for adaptive WSCE (A-WSCE) that cleanly separates the functional and non-functional requirements of a new service, and enables different environmental changes to be absorbed at different stages of composition and execution. We use Synthy, a prototype service creation environment, to implement our solution and demonstrate its effectiveness

With the sweeping progress of service computing technology and crowdsourcing, individuals are offering their capability as human services online. Companies are orchestrating human services for complex problem-solving, resulting in the rapid growth of human service ecosystems nowadays. Considering the unique characteristics of human services, like capability growth and human-involving collaboration, it is essential to understand the patterns of the development and collaboration among human services. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-layer time-aware heterogeneous network model to quantify the evolution in the human service ecosystem. Based on the model, an exploratory empirical study is presented to uncover how human service providers and consumers develop their capability in service provision and orchestration, as well as how human services collaborate with each other over time. Insights from the emerging patterns open a gateway for further research to facilitate human service adoption, including human service composition recommendation, human skill expansion suggestion, and systematic mechanism design.

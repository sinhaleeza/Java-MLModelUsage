Specifying and monitoring service level agreements (SLA) has been the subject of intensive research. However methods for enforcing SLA have not addressed the specific issues of composite web services. Our work focuses on the problem of ensuring prearranged SLAs for service workflow via SLA aware workflow scheduling (SLAAWS). The novel scheduling algorithm takes into account the workflow structure, utilization of component services and quality of service (QoS) obligations defined in SLA.

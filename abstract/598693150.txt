Recently, Web services have become a new technology trend for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and more and more applications based on Web services are emerging. One of the problems in using Web services in business applications such as logistics is services composition automatically and efficiently. In this paper, we present a Dynamic, Demand-Driven Web services Engine called D3D-Serv to implement composite service functionality that is used to dynamically build composite services from existing services according to different business logics and requirements. In this D3D-Serv framework, the most challenging function to implement is dynamic selection of service providers at run time. The highly dynamic and distributed nature of Web services often makes some service providers overloaded at certain times while others idle. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient services selection and execution strategy that is based on the queuing theory and can provide guarantees for the QOS (Quality of Service) under provider's limited resources. Preliminary experimental results have shown that this algorithm is effective.

Dynamic service composition in wireless environment provides us with a promising approach to build complex applications based on the basic value-added services. In different network domains, multiple services may provide data with different security levels. In order to prevent from information leakage, information flow security is a major concern in composite services. However, the energy-limited nature of user terminal in mobile computing environments poses a significant challenge for the centralized information flow verification where the verification node need cost lots of computation and network resources. In this paper, we specify the security constraints for each service participant to secure the information flow in service chain based on the lattice model, and then present a decentralized information flow verification framework that cooperates different service participants to complete the verification process distributively with respect to their information flow policies. Through the experiments and evaluations, the results show it decreases the verification cost on single service node.

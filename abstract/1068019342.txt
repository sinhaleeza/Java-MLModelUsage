The Internet of Things (IoT), which connects things to the Internet, is being ushered in recent years. On top of that, the Web of Things (WoT) presents a new World Wide Web (WWW) with vast contents from thing resources. To date, these resources are being exploited only in business applications where data mining processes are run. This paper addresses a different use of these resources in which, end users are the resources' principal consumer. We propose a Browsing as a Service for the IoT that allows building representations of connected things on the Web or homepages for things. Browsing these homepages let end users to interact directly with the things, such as view things' data or carry out actuations. Our evaluation shows that the proposed homepages for things can be served well by constrained devices with computation resources as low as 16kB of memory and up to 18-MHz system clock. Using our cloud system, we present a demonstration that show how homepages for things can be designed and deployed by manufacturers and developers.

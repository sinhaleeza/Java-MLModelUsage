Quality of Service (QoS) in orchestrated web services compositions have been well studied with probabilistic and multi-dimensional models. Choreographies that involve message passing among services, on the other hand, require further analysis. In this paper, we begin with the set of QoS domains that may be studied in case of choreographies and the algebraic rules for their composition. As choreographies manage QoS composition in a distributed fashion, techniques to enrich functional specifications with QoS are examined using the model proposed in the CHOReOS project. These are further analyzed with choreographies that may reconfigure due to functional or QoS requirements. Studies on the effects of such reconfiguration on multiple QoS domains can lead to better understanding of optimal runtime configurations along with associated tradeoffs. A goal programming approach is also proposed to choose Pareto optimal solutions with respect to diverse QoS domains.

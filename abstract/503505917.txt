Grid computing is becoming a mainstream technology for sharing large-scale resources, accomplishing collaborative tasks and integrating distributed systems. Information service plays a very important role in grid computing environment. Through information service grid applications are able to exploit the knowledge about current grid status and configuration to adapt themselves to changes in heterogeneous, dynamic environments. We propose a framework of information service based on the testbed ShanghaiGrid. In GT3, the index service in MDS can not provide a reliable indexing, while in our framework, using the notification method to contact grid services to index service to provide a reliable indexing. The information that information service should provide according with the ShanghaiGrid is discussed in detail.

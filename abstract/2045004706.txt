Peer-to-peer applications harness sharing between free resources (storage, contents, services, human presence, etc.). Most existing wireless P2P applications concern merely the sharing of a variety of contents. For magnifying the extent of the sharing in wireless P2P (WP2P) environment, This work presents a P2P mobile service sharing infrastructure that empowers an autonomous peer to propel distributed problem solving (e.g., in the travel domain) through service sharing and execution in an intelligent way. This infrastructure of service composition is not only highly robust to failure but also keenly aware of the surrounding context in wireless environments. We also have implemented this infrastructure into a system platform named UbiSrvInt (that shows promising evaluation results).

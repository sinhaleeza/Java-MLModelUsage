Nowadays personalised service provisioning becomes more feasible due to the increasing availability of smart devices, such as smart phones, tablet computers, Personal Digital Assistants and Play stations. These smart devices can dynamically detect the context data and upload them to support other interesting software applications, such as Facebook and Google maps. Context can become richer and more retrievable if links are established for semantically related context data sets. Taking advantage of the recent digital and Web technologies, this paper proposes a novel Linked Context model that applies the Linked Data principles to model and obtain context data from both users and services in one unified framework to support personalised service provisioning at runtime.

Today's computationally able mobile devices are capable of acting as service providers as opposed to their traditional role as consumers. To address the challenges associated with the development of these mobile services, we have developed Odin, a middleware which masks complexity, allowing rapid development of mobile services. Odin, however, does not allow cross-platform development, which is an important concern with today's wide variety of mobile devices. To solve this problem, we have designed Odin Tools - a model-driven toolkit for cross-platform development of mobile services. Leveraging appropriate metamodels, a prototype has been implemented in Eclipse and Marama that allows developers to model mobile services in a platform-independent manner. We are currently working on transformations between levels of the model hierarchy which will allow full Odin-based service implementations to be generated automatically.

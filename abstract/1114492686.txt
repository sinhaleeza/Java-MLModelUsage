Semantic Web approaches are often used for Web service description, modeling, semantics discovery, capabilities matching, etc. However, as the primary querying tool for Semantic Web, SPARQL is yet to be deeply explored to support Semantic Web service composition. Therefore the description, modeling and composition of Semantic Web services are usually two-tier. This paper extends SPARQL to support path query, so that SPARQL is used in our service composition framework which finds the top-k shortest data flows that satisfy the user constraints. Experiment results on real-world Web service datasets exhibit its applicable performance compared with service compositions using other SPARQL engines/extensions.

Service differentiation is a practical approach for service provider to deliver ldquogoodrdquo service quality to different customers or customer segments under limited computing resources. In this paper, we address the problem of differentiating business process services by effectively scheduling tasks inside business processes, where dynamic value of service request, process instance execution status and workload of service components are all taken into consideration. Corresponding framework architecture and a scheduling algorithm are purposed for this purpose.

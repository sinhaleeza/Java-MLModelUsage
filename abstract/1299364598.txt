The cloud computing has become the most popular service model with a proven ability to reduce costs and improve resource efficiency. However cloud platform also suffer from potent attacks from internal and external environment. The cooperation with Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) has becoming a compelling solution to the security and privacy risks in the cloud platform. But it is difficult to deploy and manage a variety of security service efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, ESI-Cloud (Easy Security services Integration Cloud), to facilitate the integration of multiple managed security services into a cloud computing platform. ESI-Cloud utilizes virtual machine introspection to monitor and analyze the guest VMs execution information. It also provides a client library with rich APIs and a management console to the managed security service providers (MSSPs), with which multiple security services can be easily integrated into the basic cloud platform. We have implemented ESI-Cloud in the Xen hypervisor platform and evaluated the system functionality and performance.

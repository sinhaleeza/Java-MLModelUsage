In this paper, we present a semantic web services composition framework based on a distributed architecture and on semantic and uniform based- ontology service descriptions. Central to our work is the use of the concept of community of services. Community constitutes a unified, homogeneous and consistent access interface to existing and heterogeneous e- services which propose similar functionalities for services belonging to this community. Moreover, based on OWLS language, our framework supports a rich expressivity in services and user constraints descriptions. It takes into account the nondeterministic behaviors of e-services instances, in particular when their internal state cannot be predicted in advance. In our framework, we use an operational semantic given par Statecharts formalism to make composition execution strategies model.

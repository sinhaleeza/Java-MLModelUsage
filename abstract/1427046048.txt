Choreographies are contracts specifying from a global point of view the legal interactions that must take place among a set of services. Such a contract may serve as a reference in the development of concurrent distributed system, whether it is achieved following a top-down or a bottom-up approach. In this article, we present VerChor, a generic, modular, and extensible framework for supporting the development based on choreographies. It relies on a choreography intermediate format (CIF) into which several existing choreography description languages can be transformed. VerChor builds around a set of formal properties whose verification is central to choreography-based development. To support this development process, we propose a connection between CIF and the CADP verification toolbox, which enables the full automation of the aforementioned properties. Finally, we illustrate a practical use of the VerChor framework through its integration with the Eclipse BPMN 2.0 designer.

One of the most interesting aspects of WSs is the possibility to combine them into Composite Web Services (CWSs). While Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) has emerged as the most popular language to orchestrate services, it introduces serious challenges with respect to the manageability of CWSs. This paper shows an approach to overcome these challenges with a model-aware execution of CWSs based on the Coloured Petri Nets(CPN) modeling language. Although the use of any mathematically grounded formalism enables verification of properties of CWSs, here it is used at runtime to guide the execution of the CWS. This paper presents the architecture and evaluation of using CPN as means for the model-aware execution, monitoring and runtime optimizations of CWSs. Compared to BPEL, the model-aware approach based on CPN significantly improves the performance.

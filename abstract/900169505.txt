In this paper, we propose an event-based framework that allows to specify and reason about the monitoring properties during composition process execution. The proposed approach is highly expressive and allows to specify monitoring properties that can be based on either functional or non-functional requirements, allows multi-level detection of any violation, allows to calculate effects of any such violation on the overall process execution and to recover from it using a set of recovery actions. The choice of a reasoning based approach allows to foresee the effects of violations and respects any functional and non-functional constraints associated with the process, when performing recovery. In addition, as the approach builds upon an event-based declarative framework called DISC, it results in an integrated approach as both composition design and monitoring framework are event-based.

Hybrid cloud computing paradigm has recently be widely advocated, where Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers can extend their local services into the public clouds seamlessly. In this way, dynamic user request workload to a SaaS can be elegantly handled with the rented computing capacity in public cloud. However, although a hybrid cloud may save cost compared with the private cloud, it still introduces considerable renting cost and communication cost. How to optimize such an operational cost becomes one major concern for the SaaS providers to adopt such a hybrid cloud computing paradigm. However, this critical problem remains unanswered in the current state of the art. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the operational cost for the hybrid cloud model by theoretically analyzing the problem with a Lyapunov optimization framework, and accordingly providing an online dynamic provision algorithm. In this way, our approach can address the real-world challenges where no a priori information of public cloud renting prices is available and the future probability distribution of user requests is unknown. We then conduct experimental study based on a set of real-world data, and the results confirm that our algorithm can work well in reducing the cost.

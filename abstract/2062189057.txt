An important problem in Web services composition process is optimal selection of services meeting the user functional requirements (tasks of a workflow) and ensuring a reliable execution of the composition. Therefore, non-functional properties of services such as their transactional behavior as well as their Quality of Service (QoS) must be considered. In this context, a challenging objective is to assist users in integrating on the fly the operations of services to realize their required tasks by further meeting their transactional and QoS preferences. Towards this purpose, we present SPLTQSSS, a Software Product Line based approach for Stateful (conversation-based) Service Selection problem with Transactional and QoS support. SPL-TQSSS considers the set of functionally-equivalent services as part of a service family by modeling their internal operations using Feature Models. Then, SPL-TQSSS chooses the best services, from the service families matching with every task of the workflow, which fit with the user transactional preference and satisfy QoS constraints.

The barriers to offering mobile distributed services continue to be prohibitive for most: not only must these services be implemented, but they would also inevitably compete for resources on people's devices. This is in part because of the lack of precise understanding, specification, and analysis of such services. This paper presents MobDisS (Mobile Distributed Services), a model for representing mobile distributed services, allowing them to be carefully studied. Services can be built by composing simpler services. MobDisS is built on the Actor model, which is a well-established model for formalizing concurrent computations in open and distributed systems. The paper presents the syntax and operational semantics of MobDisS, and illustrates its use in specifying services.

In the past ten years many assessment approaches have been proposed to help manage software process quality. However, few of them are configurable and real-time in practice. Hence, it is advantageous to find ways to monitor the current status of software processes and detect the improvement opportunities. In this paper, we introduce a web- based prototype system (Continuous SPA) on continuous assessing and monitoring software process, and perform a practical study in one process area: project management. Our study results are positive and show that features such as global management, well-defined responsibility and visualization can be integrated in process assessment to help improve the software process management.

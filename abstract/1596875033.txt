Providing an easily accessible data service with high quality data is important for building big data applications. In this paper, we introduce a big data service for managing and accessing massive-scale biomedical image data. The service includes three major components: a NoSQL database for storing images and data analytics results, a client consisting of a group of query scripts for data access and management, and a data quality enhancement component for improving the performance of data analytics. Low-quality data can result in incorrect analytics results and may lead to no value even harmful conclusions. Therefore, it is important to provide an effective mechanism for ensuring data quality improvement in a big data service. We describe the implement ion of a deep learning classifier to automatically filter low quality data in datasets. To improve the effectiveness of data separation, the classifier is rigorously validated with synthetic data generated by a collection of scientific tools. Design of big data services with data quality improvement as an integral component, along with the best practices collected from this experimental study, will help researchers and practitioners to develop strategies for improving the quality of big data services, building big data applications, and designing machine learning classifiers.

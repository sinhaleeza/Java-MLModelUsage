With the increasing demand for dynamic web service composition, traditional web service registries are no longer adequate in providing precise service selection. To address this problem, the paper proposes a fine-grain structural concept for traditional service registries, called web service community. Efficient semantic-level service enquiry and community management depend on context information. This paper investigates the issue of context modeling and proposes four categorizations of context information for service composition. Several design issues that relate to these context information are discussed, including community organization, context-aware management and semantic-level web service query.

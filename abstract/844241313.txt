With the prevalence of the online to offline (O2O) commerce, the short-distance instant logistics service becomes increasingly popular in China, which is a new logistics model emerged recently and provides timely logistics for O2O local life service. Being different from traditional logistics, extra waiting time generates when order's pick-up location arrival time is early than its pick-up ready time, and dynamic orders dispatch strategy is also a key factor affecting overall logistics service quality. However, existing industry practices are dispatching orders to nearest couriers and logistics sequences are arranged by couriers themselves. To improve overall dispatch solutions, we present a smart dynamic order dispatch system (SmartDODS), and a personalized logistics sequence recommendation (PLSR) service to optimize couriers logistics sequence in real-time. At last, we use historical dispatch data set of SHBJ to evaluate our system performance. The experimental results demonstrate our system can effectively optimize logistics dispatch solutions.

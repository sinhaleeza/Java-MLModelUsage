Web Services are a technology based on the Service Oriented Architecture that enables communication between applications through the Internet. Using Web Services, it is possible to send any type of information in any form of encryption. In this context, different techniques have been used to attach binary files in SOAP messages. However, there is no consensus on which technique has the best performance. This paper presents a performance evaluation study with three techniques for Web Service attachments: Pure Binary, MTOM and SwA. A testing environment was configured to verify the influence of the network and the size of files. Also, we present a tool called WSATPerf that supports the execution of the performance evaluation.

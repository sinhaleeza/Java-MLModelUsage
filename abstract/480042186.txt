Cloud computing environment requires a more open and loosely-coupled service and resource management model. Web Services for Management specification (WS-Management), as an initiative of DMTF organization, can help to manage IT resources cross multiple domains in cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a novel WS-Management-based Cloud-oriented resource management model. We describe the main components of this model. And then, we discuss our management model verification experimental scheme focusing on DASH resource. Finally, we present conclusion and future work.

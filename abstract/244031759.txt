Public transit generates a wide range of diverse data, which include static data and high-velocity data streams from sensors. Integrating and processing this big real-time data is a challenge in developing analytical systems for public transit. We here propose MOBANA (MOBility ANAlyzer), a distributed stream-based system, which provides real-time information to a wide range of users for monitoring and analyzing the performance of public transit. To do so, MOBANA integrates the diverse data sources of public transit, and converts them into standard and exchangeable data formats. In order to manage such diverse data, we propose a layered architecture, where each layer handles a specific kind of data. MOBANA is designed to be efficient. e.g., it identifies the real time position of vehicles by adjusting planned position with real-time data as needed, thus dropping network load. MOBANA is implemented by Distributed Stream Processing Engine (DSPE) and Distributed Messaging System (DMS), which pursue scalable, efficient and reliable real-time processing and analytics. MOBANA was deployed as pilot in Pavia, and tested with real data.

This paper proposes to enhance the dynamism and the flexibility of Java Enterprise Edition (EE) servers by introducing a service-oriented architecture (SOA) inside. The purpose is to ease the deployment and offer dynamic server configuration and reconfiguration. Such an approach limits consumed resources and is capable of context adaptation. After defining the properties that must be verified for the service platform, we propose to use OSGi technology as the basis for the architecture. We have experimented with integrating OSGi into Java EE servers. Moreover, this architecture has been chosen for the next generation of JOnAS ObjectWeb's open source Java EE implementation

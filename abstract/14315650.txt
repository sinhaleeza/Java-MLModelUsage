In their current scope, existing business process modeling methods and techniques lack comprehensive constructs for representing some of the essential business concepts, including business goals, non-functional requirements and resources. Chances are, there will never be a single technique that adequately captures all the business concepts on a single diagram. This paper has two related purposes: First, it evaluates the modeling capabilities of process modeling techniques against the Zachman Framework. Second, it proposes a multi-perspective integration framework for bridging the identified gaps using other requirements modeling techniques such as goal-oriented and data-oriented techniques. A real world case study is then used to demonstrate the integration process. Ultimately, our framework aims at supporting the creation of comprehensive models and facilitating a common understanding of business perspectives regardless of how they are represented.

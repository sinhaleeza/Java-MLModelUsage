With the increasing presence of web services on the Internet, Quality of Service (QoS) is becoming important for describing non-functional characteristics of web services, and is often employed in web service composition. As QoS is an aggregated concept consisting of several attributes, service composition on enormous candidate sets is a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we study the problem from a general Pareto-optimal angle, seeking to reduce the search space in service composition. QoS attributes are systematically studied according to their different types of aggregation pattern in service composition, and QoS-based dominance relationships between candidates and between workflows are defined. Taking advantage of pruning candidates by dominance relationships and constraint validations at candidate level, a service composition algorithm using partial selection technique is proposed, which is able to significantly reduce the search space and achieve great performance gains. A careful analysis of the optimality of our approach is provided, and its efficacy is further validated by empirical evaluation.

This paper presents an approach to the runtime management of decentralized service compositions. The goal of the approach is to transparently observe the behavior of peer-to-peer service interaction in order to permit the introduction of adaptive behavior. The design includes a monitoring component that utilizes a choreography model to formulate a global view of the application, and introduce adaptive behavior in a unique way. The design incorporates a mechanism for transforming the choreography to introduce redundancy, and dynamic selection in the interaction.

In the Image Processing domain, automated generation of complex Image Processing functionality is highly desirable, e.g., for rapid prototyping. Service composition techniques, in turn, facilitate automated generation of complex functionality based on building blocks in terms of services. For that reason, we aim for transferring the Service Composition paradigm into the Image Processing domain. In this paper, we present our symbolic composition approach that enables us to automatically generate Image Processing applications. Functionality of Image Processing services is described by means of a variant of first-order logic, which grounds on domain knowledge operationalized in terms of ontologies. A Petri-net formalism serves as basis for modeling data-flow of services and composed services. A planning-based composition algorithm automatically composes complex data-flow for a required functionality. A brief evaluation serves as proof of concept.

High energy physics (HEP) and other scientific communities have adopted service oriented architectures (SOA) as part of a larger grid computing effort. This effort involves the integration of many legacy applications and programming libraries into a SOA framework. The grid analysis environment (GAE) (Lingen et al., 2004) is such a service oriented architecture based on the Clarens grid services framework (Steenberg et al., 2004) and is being developed as part of the compact muon solenoid (CMS) experiment at the large hadron collider (LHC) at European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). Clarens provides a set of authorization, access control, and discovery services, as well as XMLRPC and SOAP access to all deployed services. Two implementations of the Clarens Web services framework (Python and Java) offer integration possibilities for a wide range of programming languages. This paper describes the Java implementation of the Clarens Web services framework called 'JClarens' and several Web services of interest to the scientific and grid community that have been deployed using JClarens.

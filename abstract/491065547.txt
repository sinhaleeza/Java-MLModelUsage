Due to the limited capabilities and resources, edge servers cannot meet the increasingly complex and diverse service requirements in mobile edge computing environments. In this circumstance, how to dispatch the component tasks of service requests to edge and cloud servers to reduce the time delay has become a crucial problem. Therefore, we focus on this problem and propose a heuristic algorithm called GAMEC (combined Genetic algorithm and simulated Annealing algorithm for service selection in Mobile Edge Computing systems). The simulated experiments have demonstrated the high effectiveness of the method.

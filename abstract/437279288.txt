This paper examines the problem of Web service selection in a community. Web services reside in communities due to the similiar functionalities they offer. The selection in communities is important because each Web service provides a different level of service. Selection methods thus far only consider the satisfaction of users and neglect the satisfaction of Web services and the community to which they belong. In this paper we propose a method of selecting a Web service based on the satisfaction of all three parties - user, Web service and community. The proposed solution consists of first formalizing the selection process and then using linear programming techniques to define a score function, which can be maximized to find the best selection based on the three satisfaction factors.

The composition of Web-based services is a process that usually requires advanced programming skills and vast knowledge about specific technologies. One such modern technology is Web services. In this work, we propose a framework for the smooth composition of Web services that are targeted to provide particular government services that usually require interaction between several agencies. The goal is to allow government agencies to smoothly register simple services or create new ones based on other already registered simple or composed services. Our work has the additional goal of reducing the overhead involved in the execution of composite services by providing efficient mapping schemes to bypass intermediary composed services and allowing direct invocation of the basic services in the composition.

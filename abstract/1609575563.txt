The emergence of mobile devices brings high potential of business value. These devices include sensors, actuators, smartphones, tablets, and other complex devices. They have various computational resources, and are usually connected by wireless connections. On top of the available resources and provided services, complex tasks can be performed. Researches have focused on offloading the resource-intensive computation to stronger cloud infrastructure, or providing services on top of connected mobile devices. It remains a challenge to exploit the various resources on heterogeneous devices. In this paper, we propose a mobile environment model to describe the connected devices and study the structural and behavioral characteristics of the environments. Based on the model, we design the routing protocols and a language to support the composition of environments. We propose a framework to provide a unified, flexible and scalable service for task/process deployment and execution on top of the heterogeneous and dynamic mobile environments.

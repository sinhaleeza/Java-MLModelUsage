The explosive growth of Internet Web services has intensified the study of Service-oriented Computing (SOC). The recommendation of a Web service has become extremely common. Current approaches utilize the Quality of Service (QoS), which is based on the performance of the Web service. However, acquiring average QoS values is impractical because these values are susceptible to the uncertain Internet environment. Additionally, the performance information of a Web service does not provide the discriminative power to the user when selecting identical service candidates. In this paper, we propose Creditability of a Web service (CoS) to recommend a credible Web service. A credible Web service satisfies three features: popularity, influence and authority. We measure CoS by aggregating Web services together to form a Web service society. Then, we capture the social information for the Web service and calculate the behavior of the Web services. We use about 30,000 Web services from Programmable Web, WSDream and Seekda in the experiments. Our approach effectively recommends credible Web services and displays a better discriminative power.

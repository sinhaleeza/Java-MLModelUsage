The constraints revealed during a logical composition of services are often too abstract for automatic service composition. The abstract constraints have to be transformed to concrete attributes. This research investigates semi-automatic transformation of intermediate constraints to concrete constraints for automatic service composition. It considers simultaneously a stack of composition attributes for QoS, preferences, and logic constraints.

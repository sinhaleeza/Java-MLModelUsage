Current approaches for service adaptation focus on either the message interface aspect or the control flow interface aspect separately. Our work recognizes that message adaptation may affect control flow adaptation and vice versa in complex ways. Hence an integrated approach is necessary. We propose a framework for integration and identify a set of extendible message adaptation patterns to solve typical message mismatches. In addition we give an algorithm for generating new message adapter on the fly so as to integrate control flow considerations into message adaptation. Finally we show how these individual patterns can be combined by another algorithm to create a complete adapter for two processes. The advantages of our method are illustrated with a case study. We present the design of a prototype and show XSLT code for implementing the message transformation.

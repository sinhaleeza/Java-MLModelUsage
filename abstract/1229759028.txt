As Web services proliferate, the discovery and integration of appropriate services will become a challenging task particularly with services that share common similarities and functionalities. To assist requesters to find Web services of interest easily, we need to enhance the present service discovery mechanisms with ranking method. Enlightened by disciplines of Web 2.0, the anchor semantics enabled ranking method is proposed. In this method, the service requestor, as a consumer, can also become the producer to contribute not only the request description but also the usage reputation as part of service description. Based on case study and analogical analysis, we argue that this method improves recall and precise metrics at the same time.

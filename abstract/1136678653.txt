Summary form only given. The technology and information platform (TIP) is a three-dimensional architecture framework to effectively cope with the architecture complexity and manage the architectural assets of information system applications in a service-oriented paradigm. This holistic framework comprises the generic architecture stack (GAS), which is made up of a series of architecture layers, and the contextual spectrums, which consist of the process, abstraction, latitude, and maturity (PALM) dimensions. This paper describes the detailed attributes in the four dimensions of the contextual spectrums. The process dimension covers operations, risk, financial, resources, estimation, planning, execution, policies, governance, compliance, organizational politics, etc. The abstraction dimension deals with what, why, who, where, when, which and how (6W+1H). The latitude dimension includes principles, functional, logical, physical, interface, integration &amp; interoperability, access &amp; delivery, security, quality of services, patterns, standards, tools, skills, and so forth. Finally the maturity dimension is about performance, metrics, competitive assessment, scorecards, capacity maturity, benchmarks, service management, productivity, gap analysis, transition, etc

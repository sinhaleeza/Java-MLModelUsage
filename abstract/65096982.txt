This paper proposes a new model for caching Web service response data in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). The aim is to enable any node joining the ad hoc network to either contribute services to other nodes or to consume services offered by other nodes. This model attempts to coordinate the service discovery and service use processes while maintaining minimal communication among nodes. The system comprises proxy caches (PCs), for acting as the interface to remote Web services and the internally cached service responses, request directories (RDs)for caching the cache keys that act as indexes to the responses, and finally, the caching nodes (CNs) that cache the responses. The CNs are the mobile nodes that requested the cached responses while the RDs are the ones that store the cache keys generated from the submitted requests and hold pointers to the CNs that store the responses. The PCs, RDs, and CNs are added (assigned) based on need according to capability criteria. Experimental results show the superiority of the system over non-caching and illustrate its performance in terms of delay and load versus hit ratio, which is a function of the system's caching capacity

Existing Web services notification and eventing standards are useful in many applications, but they have serious limitations precluding large-scale deployments: it is impossible to use IP multicast or for recipients to forward messages to others and scalable notification trees must be setup manually. We propose a design free of such limitations that could serve as a basis for extending or complementing these standards. The approach emerges from our prior work on QSM (Ostrowski et al., 2006), a new Web services eventing platform that can scale to extremely large environments

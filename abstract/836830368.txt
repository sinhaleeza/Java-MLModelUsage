In this paper, we propose a novel approach for graph based web service matching. Our approach is inspired by spectral graph matching methods, in particular, by eigen-based projections. We introduce new mechanisms to perform the matchmaking at both structural and semantic levels. These mechanisms are based on algebraic graph techniques that make them run fast and thus suitable for large scale web service matching problems. Experimentation is provided to show the performance of the proposed approach.

Collaborative filtering is one of widely used Web service recommendation techniques. In QoS-based Web service recommendation, predicting missing QoS values of services is often required. There have been several methods of Web service recommendation based on collaborative filtering, but seldom have they considered locations of both users and services in predicting QoS values of Web services. Actually, locations of users or services do have remarkable impacts on values of QoS factors, such as response time, throughput, and reliability. In this paper, we propose a method of location-aware collaborative filtering to recommend Web services to users by incorporating locations of both users and services. Different from existing user-based collaborative filtering for finding similar users for a target user, instead of searching entire set of users, we concentrate on users physically near to the target user. Similarly, we also modify existing service similarity measurement of collaborative filtering by employing service location information. After finding similar users and services, we use the similarity measurement to predict missing QoS values based on a hybrid collaborative filtering technique. Web service candidates with the top QoS values are recommended to users. To validate our method, we conduct series of large-scale experiments based on a real-world Web service QoS dataset. Experimental results show that the location-aware method improves performance of recommendation significantly.

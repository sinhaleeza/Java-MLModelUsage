During past few years, how to achieve load balance using efficient software on cloud architecture is posing significant challenges to the research community. Due to the access conflictions among the shared hardware resources like distributed file systems and database transactions, creditable measures like mutex based locks, semaphore schemes, and global run queues have been widely applied. However, growing with the data scale and integration of multiprocessors in the cloud computing environment, each processor has to obtain the global lock of the system run queue, which brings inevitable burden for the runtime support. In this paper, we propose a novel lock free structure, named FairPlay, which is able to support service migration through duplex buffers between processors. Based on the buffer based structure, a load balance scheduling algorithm is presented to handle the service allocation asynchronously. Experimental results on the modified Linux operating system kernel demonstrate that the lock free mechanism could efficiently reduce the overheads on the locks with great scalability and affordable overheads.

Managing service quality in heterogeneous Cloud environments is complex: different Cloud providers expose different management interfaces. To manage Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in this context, we have developed the rSLA framework that enables fast setup of SLA monitoring in dynamic and heterogeneous Cloud environments. The rSLA framework is made up of three main components: the rSLA language to formally represent SLAs, the rSLA Service, which interprets the SLAs and implements the behavior specified in them, and a set of Xlets - lightweight, dynamically bound adapters to monitoring and controlling interfaces. In this paper, we present the rSLA framework, and describe how it enables the monitoring and enforcement of service level agreements for heterogeneous Cloud services.

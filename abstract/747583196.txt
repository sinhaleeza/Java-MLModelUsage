Runtime anomalies occurring to service-based systems (SBSs) must be located and fixed in a timely manner in order to guarantee successful delivery of outcomes in response to user requests. Monitoring all component services constantly is impractical due to excessive resource consumption. Inspecting all component services upon anomalies is time-consuming and thus also impractical. In this work, we propose a novel approach that employs spectrum-based fault localisation techniques to locate runtime anomalies in SBSs. Large-scale experiments are conducted and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

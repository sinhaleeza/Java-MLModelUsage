The response time of SOAP invocation over Http is an important designing factor and evaluating metric for QoS and Web services related computing. This paper presents a novel model to compute response time of SOAP over Http/1.1. It takes several influencing parameters into account, including compression methods, maximum segment size, round trip time, initial value of time-out sequence, the number of packets per ACK, maximum congestion control window size and packet loss rate. How to set these parameters to compute the response time of SOAP over Http/1.1 is illustrated and the model is validated with TPC-H benchmark based simulation data.

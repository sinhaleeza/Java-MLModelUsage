In our earlier work, competitive Web services market was proposed to address one of the major business concerns, namely "competitiveness", of the current Web services research. This paper aims to attack the issues of how to model and analyze competitive Web services market, which ranges from the service node at the micro level to the competitive composite service providers at the macro level. Moreover, in order to tackle and contain the randomness embedded in a Web services system, we apply the Markov chain theory to analyze the availability of Web services market. Moreover, we analyze the stochastic performance of the Web services market using queuing theory and propose the adaptive control methodology to improve the performance.

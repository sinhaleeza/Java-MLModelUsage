In recent years, Web service technologies are becoming more and more important communication scheme for grid environment. WSRF-based resource management components, such as WS-GRAM in GT4, lay emphasis on how to make existing procedures such as local scheduler be invoked via HTTP, so that they inevitably have two problems described below. (1) If assumed environment is cluster type grid, each worker node does not have access scheme to any information included in resource property of master node. (2) As a result, the contents of information sent to clients is forced by the local scheduler and therefore clients can not control job status in accordance with their own policy. If those two problems are resolved, any client's own resource management policy can be reflected on worker nodes. In this paper, we propose a method for resolving those problems in order to realize the interactive communication between clients and worker nodes for WSRF-based cluster grid.

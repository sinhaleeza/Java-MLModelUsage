A new fine-grained parallel programming model - Thin Kernel model is brought forth. In this model, the partitions of the parallel tasks are separated from the computational kernel of the problem. The Thin Kernel model produces parallel tasks dynamically at runtime when the tasks are being scheduled which makes the task assignment method in the Thin Kernel model real and distributed. The Thin Kernel model uses dynamic class loading and on-demand code transport. The collaboration of these technologies paves the way for large-scale parallel computing over wide-area networks.

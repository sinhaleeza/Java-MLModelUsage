In this paper, we propose a process calculus, Context-aware System Calculus (CSC), in order to describe context-aware systems that can maintain context models and carry out some operations, including requesting context-aware services, according to the context rules. Besides, a context-aware system can also communicate with other systems or receive context information from context providers by sharing atoms through channels. We present the syntax and semantics of CSC, and demonstrate several case studies to model context-aware systems with CSC, concentrating especially on human factors in one of the examples. We also show its strong expressive power by encoding Pi-calculus as CSC.

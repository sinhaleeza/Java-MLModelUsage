IT outsourcing enables companies to contract out IT services, such as infrastructure and application management to external providers. IT services delivery relies on knowledge that is in the collective possession of application and infrastructure specialists. With recent advances in harnessing the expertise of network-connected humans, services businesses have also started to seek strategies to efficiently utilize the collective knowledge of their employees. In this paper, we present the application of collective intelligence to three different service types: 1) automation (translation solution), 2) infrastructure management (asset inventory discovery) and 3) application management (software development). We extrapolate a set of salient properties (i.e., input, output, and size of the collective input) as the key elements for employing collective intelligence within the services business. We discuss some of the differences amongst the disparate collective intelligence services and present the resulting distinctive properties as challenges that may inspire further research in services business.

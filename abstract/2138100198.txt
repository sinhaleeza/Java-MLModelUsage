The existing distributed ontology evolution approaches are not scaled to dynamic environments like Semantic service architecture (SSOA). As the SSOA-based system grows in size, the complexity of ontology change management increases, especially if the services ontologies are heterogeneous. In this paper, a novel agent-based ontology evolution framework is developed for services which consume ontologies in semantic SOA-based applications. A prototype is built by using the JADE agent platform for evaluation.

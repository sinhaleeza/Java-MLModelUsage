Service flow in SOA systems need to detect quality of service (QoS) problems and to guarantee end-to-end performance. In previous work, we have proposed two faulty service identification methods: a dependency matrix based diagnosis and a Bayesian network based diagnosis. In this paper, we present a hybrid diagnosis to achieve high diagnosis accuracy and low diagnosis cost. The hybrid diagnosis reduces the problem size by applying dependency matrix based diagnosis result in Bayesian network and excluding services that are not critical to the end-to-end QoS from the diagnosis. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the hybrid diagnosis is similar to the Bayesian network diagnosis yet reduces more than 90% of the diagnosis time.

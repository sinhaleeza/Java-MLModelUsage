As research and development in Web Services and Services Computing has only existed for approximately a decade and half, it is remarkably that it has lead to a multi-billion dollar services industry. The first major research conference on the subject, the International Conference on Web Services, just started in 2003. Research in services computing is active and multifaceted. This special issue of IEEE Transactions on Services Computing considers two areas in services computing that have experienced “Recent Advances in Web Services Research”: Security, Privacy, and Trust; and New Approaches to Services Composition. It consists of the best extended papers from the two premier research conferences on services computing: the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Web Services and the 2016 IEEE Conference on Services Computing.

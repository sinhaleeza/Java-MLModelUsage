In the last few years different solutions have been proposed for the composition of Web APIs. In this paper we focus on the scalability problems appearing when the software platform in charge of executing Service Compositions (which are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs, DAGs) is supposed to support huge numbers of concurrent executions. This is the case of viral applications as well as of Cloud Computing scenarios where Service Compositions are deployed and executed in multi-tentant platforms implementing different paradigms such as Business Process as a Service, Mashup as a Service, Service Composition as a Service. The proposed solution exploits the Asynchronous I/O paradigm for the efficient utilization of system resources such as threads and memory.

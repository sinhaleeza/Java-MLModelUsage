Service-oriented architectures and web services have been used to foster the development of loosely coupled, interoperable, and distributed applications. Mission-critical and business process systems can be implemented with them, requiring a high level of quality. Model-based testing allied with state models is a promising candidate due to its efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a model-based testing process to verify service-oriented applications. Finite state machines are used to model and support the test case generation. We evaluated the applicability of our process with a case study using a prototype tool.

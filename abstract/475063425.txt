Data lakes have recently emerged as an alternative solution to costly traditional data warehouse solutions. To exploit data lakes, however, there is a need for means that assist users in combining and integrating data stored within a data lake. In this paper, we position ourselves in the recurrent context where a user has a local dataset that is not sufficient for processing the queries that are of interest to him/her. We show how data lakes, or more specifically the service lakes, since we are focusing on data providing services, can be leveraged to answer user queries, taking into account the quality of the services and respecting the (time and monetary) budget set by the user.

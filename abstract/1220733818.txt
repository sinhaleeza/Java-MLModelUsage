This paper is faced with group sensing problem, where HD map producers motivate private cars to collect data from real world. Group sensing needs vehicles to communicate physically, and drivers to collaborate strategically. First we consider communication module, three VANET-based methods are proposed to achieve inter-vehicle message relaying. Secondly, we consider collaboration module which motivates drivers to be participants, three motivating methods are derived by integrating relaying methods with collaborating strategies. Some combinations of two modules are discussed and classified from centralized or distributed perspective. Finally, we simulate and analyze two modules. The results shows that centralized method could motivate collaboration at a low price, but brings about heavy communication overhead. In contrast, distributed method requires more incentives and less communication overhead than centralized method. Map producers need to make a balance between communication module and collaboration module if they want to improve effectiveness of group sensing.

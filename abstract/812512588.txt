With Internet becoming ubiquitous, electronic transactions over the Internet have become an integral part of day to day life. The Internet is used for more and more secure transactions like banking, shopping, submitting tax returns etc. In a way, the need for a secure Internet based electronic voting system is an obvious demand. The task of designing a secure Internet based voting system is a cryptographic challenge. This paper proposes and discusses the design and implementation of secure Internet based electronic voting system using Identity Based Encryption System (IBES). This proposed system satisfies various security requirements like, privacy, anonymity, eligibility, accuracy, fairness, uniqueness, verifiability and receipt freeness. Total user anonymity is achieved using IBES.

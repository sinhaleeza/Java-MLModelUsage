While Web Services Security (WSS) enhances the security of web services, it may also introduce additional performance overheads to standard web services due to additional CPU processing and larger messages transferred. In this paper, we aim at clarifying this concern by conducting a quantitative performance evaluation of WSS overhead. Based on the evaluation, we extend our existing web services performance model by taking the extra WSS overheads into account. The extended performance model is validated on different environments with different messages sizes and WSS security policies.

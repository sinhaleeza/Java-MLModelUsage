With the incredible popularity of cloud computing, the adoption of mass customization (MC) is significant for building a cloud computing system that could provide services provisioning in a manner of multi-tenancy. Because of lack of a standard architecture that supports MC development for cloud services, the existing metadata or model driven approaches have insufficient abilities to realize personalized requirements with mass production when applied to product development in large-scale enterprises. Aiming at these problems, this paper presents a novel MC-based development approach for enterprise-level business cloud services based on the specification of the Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA), and shares the practice about how the approach is applied to building Kingdee K/3 Collaboration Development Cloud (CDC). Successful practice has proved that by adopting our MC development approach, we can develop platforms and tools on the cloud at a low cost and more effectively.

Semantic Web services have been envisioned in the form of different conceptual models like OWL-S, WSMO and WSDL-S. Web services execution environment (WSMX) is our reference implementation for semantic Web service conceptual model, WSMO. In this paper, we have investigated the communication problems that semantic Web services systems are facing. We have proposed how to overcome these problems by using triple space computing as an extended space-based computing paradigm for semantic Web data. We have proposed the usage of triple space computing to improve the internal communication and coordination during the process of execution of semantic Web services. We also have presented and analyzed the experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

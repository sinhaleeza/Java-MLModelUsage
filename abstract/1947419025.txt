A composite service can be constructed with the arbitrary combination of sequential, parallel, loop, and conditional structures. In this paper, we propose a general solution to calculate the QoS for composite services with complex structures. We also show QoS-based service selection can be conducted based on the proposed QoS calculation method. An application example is given to show the effectiveness of the method.

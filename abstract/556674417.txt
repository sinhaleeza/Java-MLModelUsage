In this paper, we explore the use of domain-independent and domain-specific ontologies to find matching service descriptions. The domain-independent relationships are derived using an English thesaurus after tokenization and part-of-speech tagging. The domain-specific ontological similarity is derived by an inference on the semantic annotations associated with Web service descriptions. Matches due to the two cues are combined to determine an overall semantic similarity score. By combining multiple cues, we show that better relevancy results can be obtained for service matches from a large repository, than could be obtained using any one cue alone.

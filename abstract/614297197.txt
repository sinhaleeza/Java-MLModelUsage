IoT service and service composition provide an effective means to develop IoT applications based on correlating multiple sensor data. The change of specific sensor data can cause others' changes under uncertain situations. It makes difficult for defining service composition plan in advance to build IoT application. This paper proposes a data-driven service composition method based on our previous proactive data service model. We regard service events frequently happen together with given service event as its situation, and the service events happen next as reacted actions under the situation. We analyze two kinds of correlation among service events via an improved FP-tree algorithm, and realize the service composition at runtime based on the real-time service events. Based on the real sensor data set in a coal-fired power plant, a series of experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively detect new service events based on current service events.

This work deals with services composition. We propose an approache based on Symbolic Observation Graphs (SOG) allowing to decide whether two (ore more) web services can cooperate safely. The compatibility between two web services is defined by the well known soundness property on open workflow nets and checked on the composition of SOGs instead of the original web services composition. This allows to respect the privacy of the services since SOGs are base on collaborative activities only and hide the internal structure and behavior of the corresponding service.

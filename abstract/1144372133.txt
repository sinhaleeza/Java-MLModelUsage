Process measurement is the task of empirically and objectively assigning numbers to the attributes of processes in such a way as to describe them. We define process complexity as the degree to which a process is difficult to analyze, understand or explain. One way to analyze a process' complexity is to use a process control-flow complexity measure. This measure analyzes the control-flow of processes and can be applied to both Web processes and workflows. In this paper, we discuss how to evaluate the control-flow complexity measure to ensure that it can be qualify as a good and comprehensive one.

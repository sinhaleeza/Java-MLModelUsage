While services are widely regarded as an important new concept in IT architecture, so far there is no consolidated concept about the exact meaning of the term "service orientation". While there are many problems which are simply problems of certain technical decisions, other areas are more fundamental and lead to different perspectives and eventually implementations of service oriented systems. We argue that the current emphasis of service orientation as a collection of interface descriptions misses the critical point of services, which is that they revolve around resources. With a more resource-centered approach, the investment into a service oriented architecture can be made much more promising, because the resource-centered approach is better suited for the design of loosely coupled systems than the current interface-based approach.

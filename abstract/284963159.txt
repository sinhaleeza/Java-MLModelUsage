With the development of Service oriented Computing (SOC), more and more functionally similar Web services are deployed over the Web. Quality of service (QoS) aspects (e.g., availability, response time, etc.) are thus crucial for selecting among functionally similar Web services. Moreover, the skyline has been considered as an important concept for selecting Web service based on QoS. In this paper, we propose WS-Sky, a Web service selection framework based on QoS. Our framework leverages two variants of the notion of skyline to effectively and efficiently select Web services that better fit the user needs. Our experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that WS-Sky assists users to find the most relevant Web services in a flexible way, and allows users to control the size of the retrieved Web services.

J2EE components and APIs have remained largely unmined, and their potential as performance barometers therefore largely unrealized, because the tools businesses have traditionally wielded to service transactions - database servers, directory services, application servers themselves - have been unable to provide businesses and software developers the access they need to capture, measure, and optimize discrete transactions. Businesses that lack insight into J2EE components and APIs lack the ability to manage some of e-business's most vital performance assets, assets that, when performing poorly or not at all, can down whole distributed applications. This paper discusses the requirements of J2EE application performance management systems and five commercial tools.

Traditional system-oriented dependability metrics like reliability and availability do not fully reflect the impact of system failure-repair behavior in service-oriented environments. The telecommunication systems community prefers to use Defects Per Million (DPM), defined as the number of calls dropped out of a million calls due to failures, as a user-perceived dependability metric. In this paper, we provide new formulation for the computation of the DPM metric for a system supporting Voice over IP functionality using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). We evaluate different replication schemes that can be used at the SIP application server. They include the effects of software failure, failure detection, recovery mechanisms, and imperfect coverage for recovery mechanisms. We derive closed-form expressions for the DPM taking into account the transient behavior of recovery after a failure. Our approach and underlying models can be readily extended to other types of service-oriented environments.

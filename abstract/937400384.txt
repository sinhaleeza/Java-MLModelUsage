Heterogeneity and dynamicity of pervasive, service-based environments require the construction of flexible multimodal interfaces at run time. In this paper, we present how we use an autonomic approach to build and maintain adaptable input multimodal interfaces in smart building environments. We have developed an autonomic solution relying on interaction models specified by interaction designers and mediation components implemented by software developers. An interaction model is built around the notions of abstract device and abstract applications. The role of the autonomic manager is to build complete interaction techniques based on runtime conditions and in conformance with the predicted models.

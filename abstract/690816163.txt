Workflow models have been used and refined for years to execute processes within organisations. To deal with collaborative processes (choreographies) these internal workflow models have to be aligned with the external behaviour advertised through Web service interfaces. However, traditional workflow management systems (WfMS) do not offer this functionality. Simply sharing and merging process models is often not possible, because workflow management lacks a widely accepted standard theory for workflow models.Multiple research and standardisation efforts to integrate different workflow theories have been proposed over the years. XPDL is the most widely used standard for process model interchange and supported by over 80 systems.However, XPDL also lacks the possibility to relate a workflow model to its possible choreography interface abstractions.To remedy this situation, we propose to abstract the XPDL model to a higher-level model, perform the integration and the compaction algorithms at that level and then ground it back to the desired choreography models. We develop and use an integrated ontology which is based on the XPDL standard for this purpose. To facilitate the abstraction and grounding, we present a mapping procedure to automatically translate XPDL and BPMN workflow models into this ontology. After translation, these models are annotated with a parameterised role model and other collaborative properties. We present a compaction procedure that automatically maps the annotated models into external choreography interfaces that expose only the relevant information for a particular partner collaboration. Our procedure is agnostic with respect to the target choreography model. We demonstrate our approach using WSMO choreographies which enables us to automatically generate interface models from any WfMSs that supports XPDL export.

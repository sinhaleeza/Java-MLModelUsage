We present design and implementation of CyPhyS+, a comprehensive, low-cost and standard complaint Cyber Physical System for remote health monitoring of elderly staying in old age homes. It is an end-to-end 6LoWPAN based healthcare system, which provides reliable and secured medical data acquisition, on the fly medical data analytics and visualization in real-time. It is designed for low power operations and resource constraint environment. The paper describes system architecture, design and implementation details of software and hardware sub-systems. As part of the system we developed power efficient Bluetooth-6LoWPAN mote, Health Mote. The paper describes novel energy efficient end-to-end multi-stage message reliability scheme. The experimental results prsented show the efficacy of the approach. For ensuring robust operational network, CyPhyS+ employs a low power and application aware SNMP based network monitoring for 6LoWPAN multihop network. In addition, CyPhyS+ incorporates a 128-bit AES, CBC-MAC based encryption and authentication mechanism. Other notable features of CyPhyS+ include its compliance with open FHIR/HL7 medical standards, support for Restful architecture based web services, and medical data analytics of ECG. We report on the extensive field trials that have been carried out across various parts of the city.

Dynamic collaborations involve contributed resources across the organisational boundaries that are subjected to different set of policies. The management of such resources for dynamic collaborations including negotiation, validation, instantiation and termination is difficult. Existing approaches for collaborations using Web Services such as WSLA are designed to deal with scenarios involving two parties: a service provider and a service consumer. These approaches do not scale well to multiparty nature of dynamic collaborations. To address this problem, we propose a framework for a language called Web Service Collaborative Context Definition Language for dynamic collaborations. The language itself has been defined using XML Schema and has been implemented in a dynamic collaboration platform.

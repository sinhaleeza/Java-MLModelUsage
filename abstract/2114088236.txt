Collaborative scientific workflow composition has recently been proposed to support collaborative scientific research projects, which require intensive collaboration among scientists with diverse expertise. A collaborative scientific workflow management system allows participating scientists to design and compose common scientific workflows concurrently. Concurrency control has become one of the key challenges in collaborative scientific workflow composition, which aims to facilitate collaboration throughput while ensuring the correctness and consistency of the results generated from concurrent operations. We have previously proposed a locking scheme to support simple scientific workflow compositions, in which workflows are flat (not hierarchical). In this paper, we take a step forward to propose a new granular scientific workflow locking scheme, which captures dependency relationships between workflows and constructs, to support general hierarchical workflow compositions. We also conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of the concurrency control.

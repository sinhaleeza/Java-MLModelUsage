Although WS-BPEL is a widely used language for modeling executable business processes in service oriented architectures it is almost impossible to dynamically bind services at runtime taking complex constraints and optimisation goals into account. The approach presented in this paper uses semantically annotated workflow templates and extensions to introduce adaptability which enables agile service oriented architectures. The technological solution will be validated in a critical infrastructure environment where resilience and security play an important role.

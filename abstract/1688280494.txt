Web services will only have advantages over existing technologies if the service binding can be performed dynamically. However, existing service description languages do not contain enough information for a computer agent to do the selection automatically during runtime on behalf of the user. This results from the fact that in most approaches the offer description language doubles as a re-guest language, which prevents the requestor from a precise formulation of requests and preferences. Therefore, in this paper, we emphasize the need for a distinguished service request language that allows to capture all of the requestor's preferences. We present a concrete technique to represent such preference-containing requests, which is based on fuzzy object sets.

With the rapid proliferation of wireless networks and mobile devices, Mobile Peer-to-Peer (MP2P) networks have attracted a huge amount of users for resource sharing. However, in an MP2P network, peers frequently join and leave the network, which makes the network topology dynamically change. Thus, it is difficult to establish long term and effective trust relationship among peers, making trust management become a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a dynamic grouping-based trust model DGTM, to classify peers. A group is formed according to the peers' interests. The experiments illustrate that our proposed dynamic grouping-based trust model DGTM always achieves the highest successful transaction rate under different circumstances.

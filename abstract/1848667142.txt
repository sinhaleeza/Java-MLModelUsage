The growing popularity of cloud computing has magnified the rise of software reuse by facilitating service provisioning over the Internet. At the same time, a new generation of mobile apps has emerged relying on backend services that expand the app functionally, while reducing the overhead on limited mobile resources. The Web service approach promises great flexibility in offering software functionality over the network, while maintaining interoperability between heterogeneous platforms. In addition, recent years have witnessed the rise of user-facing service developments that can be consumed on-the-go with a standard interface, such as Restful Web services. However, the discovery of such services does not match their growing popularity and remain challenging. Users cannot tolerate long latency in finding relevant services to their requests. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient Web service discovery approach that uses statistical methods and indexing techniques to improve the precision and response time of the discovery process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art discovery mechanisms and significantly reduces the query response time by at least 77%, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

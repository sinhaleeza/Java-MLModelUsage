With the emerging technologies like cloud computing and Internet scale data centers, radically simplified deployment approaches are critical for the success of the even more complicated solutions. Although there have been many traditional solution deployment approaches, each of them mainly focuses on particular software type or product. In this paper, we propose the next generation solution deployment paradigm as hybrid solution deployment, which enables fast solution deployment from bare metal mode to production mode based on todaypsilas state-of-the-art provisioning tools. Solution provisioning automation (SPA) framework is our practice of such deployment paradigm. In SPA, we use solution template to capture the solution components and their dependencies, which exposes only the necessary parameters for users to customize. Provisioning Requests are placed through reservations and scheduled globally for execution. The SPA engine receives provisioning requests from scheduler, interprets the solution template, manages provisioning tasks and performs runtime logging. We also present a real world case to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

A precise definition of services is necessary in order to discover, publish, and deliver them. Services, when provided, should satisfy their binding contractual obligations, be seen as trustworthy by the users, and correctly fulfill the needs of the context in which they will be used. The FrSeC architecture proposed in this paper aims to fulfill these needs. The architecture is formally describable, supports the specification, publication, discovery, selection, and composition of services with context-dependent contracts.

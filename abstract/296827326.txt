Service oriented architectures (SOA) are becoming the prevalent approach for realizing modern services and systems. SOA offers superior support for autonomy (decoupling) and heterogeneity compared to previous generation middleware systems, resulting in more scalable and adaptive solutions. However, SOA have not adequately addressed management, while traditional management solutions do not sufficiently scale to address the needs of (global) Web services. We propose scalable management based on models and industry standards. We discuss a use case for global service management, we present its design, implementation and preliminary evaluation. We retain all the benefits of SOA while also enabling global scale manageability. Our approach provides manageability that is comprehensible for administrators yet automated enough for integration into autonomous systems.

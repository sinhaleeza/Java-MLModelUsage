This paper presents a model which combines the processing power of parallel computation with the ease of Web service usage. In this model, parallel programming environment can be embedded in a visual environment. Parallelization of Web services is provided by using multithreading technology with dataset parameters. This work also provides parallel usage of computers located in different places via a wide area network such as Internet.

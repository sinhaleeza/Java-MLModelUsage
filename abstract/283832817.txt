The rapid adoption of service-oriented architecture (SOA) in many large-scale distributed applications requires the development of adaptive service-based software systems (ASBS) with the capability of monitoring the changing system status, analyzing, and controlling tradeoffs among various quality-of-service (QoS) aspects, and adapting service configurations to satisfy multiple QoS requirements simultaneously. In this paper, our results toward the development of adaptive service-based software systems are presented. The formulation of activity-state-QoS (ASQ) models and how to use the data from controlled experiments to establish ASQ models for capturing the cause-effect dynamics among service activities, system resource states, and QoS in service-based systems are presented. Then, QoS monitoring modules based on ASQ models and SOA-compliant simulation models are developed to support the validation of the ASBS design. The main idea for developing QoS adaptation modules based on ASQ models is discussed. An experiment based on a voice communication service is used to illustrate our results.

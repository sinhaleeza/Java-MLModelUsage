We describe a novel architecture for supporting mobile information access in the occasionally connected computing environment. By utilizing user workflow, profiles, and environmental information, information from various sources published to the system is prioritized, cached and synchronized in the staging server, and eventually disseminated to mobile devices. Furthermore, workflow and user profile can help in predicting near future data needs and therefore can enable intelligent data charging

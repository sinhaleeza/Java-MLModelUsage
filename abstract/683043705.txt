There are two approaches to specifying the composition of Web services: orchestration and choreography. Previous works in Web services selection are mostly based on the orchestration model which focuses on the interactions with a single party. However, in many application scenarios, business goals are achieved by a number of pair-wise interactions among a set of Web services, and there does not exist a single entity that is in charge of selecting Web services for all tasks. Each Web service will autonomously perform Web services selection. In such a choreographic environment, we study the kind of information that each Web service should provide to its partner Web services and how each Web service should perform Web service selection so as to maximize the chance of successfully accomplishing a business goal. The proposed approach is evaluated by simulation, and the experimental results show that our proposed method is close to centralized method and better than the other two distributed Web services selection methods.

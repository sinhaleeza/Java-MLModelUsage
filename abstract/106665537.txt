The cloud computing paradigm provides an environment where services can be composed and reused at high rates. Existing composition techniques focus on providing the desired functionality and at a given deployment cost. In this paper, we focus on the definition of cloud service compositions driven by certified non-functional properties. We define a cost evaluation methodology aimed to provide the composition that minimizes the total costs of the cloud provider taking into account deployment, certification, and mismatch costs, and evaluate it using three different cost profiles.

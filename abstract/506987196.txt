WS-Eventing is a W3C specification to enable publish-subscribe Web Services. This paper proposes a WS-Eventing extension for disseminating notifications by using a UDP multicast binding. To achieve this, some specification modifications will be done which do not affect legacy client implementations. We show that it is possible to extend WS-Eventing almost without losing backward compatibility. An exemplary proxy application illustrates that the extension can be embedded into open source and proprietary Web Service frameworks.

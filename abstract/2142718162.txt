Today's Industrial growth mainly depends on the real time and on line information rather than stored data. It is a challenging one for the communication industry to provide the required information continuously without delay. As the communication industry is considered the major factor is the interconnection between the different networks and the cooperation between the service providers in the form of QoS. The major issue is the mobility management (MM) to provide and maintain connectivity between the different networks. Here in this paper an approach is proposed for MM based on the session management, location management which are common to any type of network. By considering and having the control over the common control management techniques the flow of information is maintained without/ with delay based on the services offered i.e.., either online service or offline service. Moreover the proposed work also concentrates on the allocation of the transmission channel is purely based on the type of information transmission applications involved such as data, voice, voice &amp; data, multimedia information, video images, real time video applications etc. Based on the type of application and also the network and the service provider a common procedure is being followed so as to provide a seamless transmission.

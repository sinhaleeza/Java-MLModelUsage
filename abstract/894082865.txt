Web services, with an emphasis on open standards and flexibility, can provide benefits over existing capital markets integration practices. However, Web services must first meet certain technical requirements including performance, security and so on. SOAP, based on Extensible Markup Language (XML), inherits not only the advantages of XML, but its relatively poor performance. This makes SOAP a poor choice for many high-performance Web services. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve Web services performance. Focusing on avoiding traditional XML parsing and Java reflection at runtime, we create a service-specific SOAP processor to accelerate execution. Through our experiments in this paper, we observed that our approach obtained about a treble performance gain (maximum) by incorporating the SOAP processor into the SOAP engine

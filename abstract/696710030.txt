Existing search services are inadequate for machine-based web searches since it is more difficult for machines to perceive the results of a search. This work presents an approach creating a search service that is tailored towards machine-based web search, while avoiding some of the problems associated with search results that are derived from link-based ranking algorithms. In this approach, the content of search results is enhanced by incorporating additional information which is derived from processing a set of web documents that are relevant to the search phrase. Ranking of the web pages is then based on this derived information. The search result is composed in a manner that is designed to promote relevance and aid immediate comprehension of search results.

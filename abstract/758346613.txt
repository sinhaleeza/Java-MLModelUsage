Available frameworks and middleware implementing run-time adaptivity mechanisms exploit qualities of services (QoSs) and/or other properties of the systems' resources when choosing the most appropriate one in order to provide the services requested by the users. Usually, the case studies built upon these solutions claim for an immediate execution of services. In this paper, we describe an adaptive resource management (ARM) approach which considers both the immediate execution of services and their bookings.

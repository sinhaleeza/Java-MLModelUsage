Web service interactions lie in the core of SOA. Due to the autonomy, heterogeneity and continuous evolution of Web services, mediators are usually needed to support service interactions to overcome possible mismatches that may exist among business processes. In this paper, we introduce a space-based architecture for process mediator which considers both control-flow and data-flow, present possible mismatch patterns, and suggest how they can be automatically mediated. Our work can be used to perform runtime mediation and thus to facilitate service interactions.

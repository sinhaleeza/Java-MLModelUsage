Web service has already been an important paradigm for web applications. Growing number of services need efficiently locating the desired web services. The similarity metric of web services plays important role in service search and classification. The very small text fragments in WSDL of web services are unsuitable for applying the traditional IR techniques. We describe our approach which supports the similarity search and classification of service operations. The approach firstly employs the external knowledge to compute the semantic distance of terms from two compared services. The similarity of services is measured upon these distances. Previous researches treat terms within the same WSDL documents as the isolated words and neglect the semantic association among them, hence lower down the accuracy of the similarity metric. We provide our method which tries to reflect the underlying semantics of web services by utilizing the terms within WSDL fully. The experiments show that our method works well on both service classification and query.

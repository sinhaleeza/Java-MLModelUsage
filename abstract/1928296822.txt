This paper addresses the issue of selecting Web services residing in a community. Since these Web services have similar functionalities, this selection depends on their Quality of Service (QoS). Existing approaches only consider the satisfaction of users' requirements and neglect the satisfaction of Web services' requirements and the community to which they belong. This paper proposes an approach of selecting Web services based on the satisfaction of all three parties - user, Web service, and community. The approach consists of first, formalizing the selection process and then, using integer programming to define a score function, which can be maximized to find the best selection based on three satisfaction factors. Experiments using real Web services and measurements are conducted to demonstrate the influences of the approach.

Traditional Complex Event systems (CEP) did not consider the computation requirements of continuous dynamic behavior such as differential equations. In addition, the event composition rules were predefined before the CEP engine began working. The rule defining task is error-prone and cumbersome. In this paper, therefore, a hybrid complex event service is proposed, which deals with not only discrete events but also continuous behavior computation based on IoT (Internet of Things) resource models. In order to satisfy the real-time constraints of processing IoT events, a divide-and-conquer principle is adopted, where we give a combination theorem such that different events can be processed on different IoT resources and then these processed results can be combined to derive complex events. Based on the formal IoT resources and event knowledge, we define interest goals to direct event composition without enumerating event relation to define event composition rules. We finally present event composition algorithms and evaluation to show our idea.

As a technology that can improve the efficiency of the business process, workflow is drawing more and more attentions of researchers and software product vendors. But there are still many problems waiting to be solved for workflow. One of these problems is the poor adaptability of workflow. This paper intends to enhance the adaptability from the view of supporting dynamic process change. In the paper, a workflow model that is fit for dynamic change is defined and the verification rules are firstly set up for this model. Specifically, our method is based on the concept of executable path of workflow. Based on the executable path, the concepts and algorithms of valid process and complete subprocess are introduced to solve the problems brought by process model dynamic change.

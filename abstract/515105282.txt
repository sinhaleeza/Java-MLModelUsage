Nowadays e-services are gaining strong momentum. The Web is a strongly connected environment and it is moving from being a simple collection of HTML pages toward a container of e-services. In an extremely competitive world, providers of e-service aim at satisfying user needs, providing enriched e-services characterized by high adaptivity to the context and multichannel provisioning. Providers also want to give users the opportunity of executing complex e-services or processes transparently with respect to orchestration issues. The MAIS Project is an attempt to realize a framework able to ensure all these characteristics at the same time. We present our vision of a multichannel adaptive composition framework by focusing on e-service composition and provisioning.

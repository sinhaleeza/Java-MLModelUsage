Facing fast changing and more diversified customers, specific customer oriented industries' executives should continuously make customer oriented strategic transformation decisions faster than competitors to obtain sustained growth. However, due to higher transformation cost per facility, increased frequency of transformation efforts, and greater complexity associated with rolling out quickly across large diverse facility networks, enterprises invest heavily yet often fail to deliver the required impacts. Executives in these industries are eager to have a quantitative method and tool to help them derive more scientific strategic transformation suggestions. In this paper, we describe a general analytics and optimization solution designed to provide strategic analysis services for those specific industries to adapt to the fast changing needs. The data model design is elaborated for efficient communication and quick solution development, and an implementation case study on intelligent facility network analytics and optimization services design in retailing industry is finally presented to illustrate how the proposed data model improves the flexibility of solutions across industries.

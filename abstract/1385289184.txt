These exchanges allow various companies to connect supply chains in various industries or across industries, introducing new efficiencies and ways of buying, selling, and brokering products and services. Connecting businesses through Web-services-based trading exchanges give companies the ability to transact in ways that were never before possible. These exchanges help connect buyers to sellers and provide a shorter procurement trading lifecycle.

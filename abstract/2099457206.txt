In the service-oriented architecture, component services can be composed to provide value-added services. The notion of composite service skyline facilitates obtaining a QoS-optimal service combination. State-of-the-art approach to computing composite service skyline assumes that candidate services of different tasks are independent. However, real-word services are usually QoS-correlated. To this end, we present a novel approach to computing the composite service skyline in the presence of QoS correlations. Advanced pruning techniques are proposed to accelerate our approach. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

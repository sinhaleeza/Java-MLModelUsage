Volatile requirements should be managed such that changes can be introduced into the system in a quick and structured way. This paper presents directive-oriented pattern analysis (DoPA), a requirements engineering approach that handles volatile requirements by managing the coupling between business intentions and service integration. The key insight is to utilise services as commodities via service choreography patterns. DoPA captures differentiating enterprise intentions as directives, while using patterns to handle common business needs. This enables the notion of declarative configuration of services to achieve business agility.

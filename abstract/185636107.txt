Quality of service (QoS) management in compositions of services requires careful consideration of QoS characteristics of the services and effective QoS management in their execution. A Web service is a software system that supports interoperable application-to-application interaction over the Internet. Web services are based on a set of XML standards such as simple object access protocol (SOAP). The interactions of SOAP messages between Web services form the theoretical model of SOAP message exchange patterns (MEP). Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL) defines an interoperable integration model that facilitates automated process integration in intra- and inter-corporate environments. A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a Web services requestor and provider guaranteeing quantifiable issues at defined levels only through mutual concessions. Based on a prior research work on message detail record (MDR), this paper further proposes a SOAP message tracking model for supporting QoS end-to-end management in the context of WSBPEL and SLA. This paper motivates the study of QoS management in a Web service composition framework with the evolution of a distributed toolkit in an industrial setting.

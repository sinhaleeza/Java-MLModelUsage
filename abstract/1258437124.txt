In order to build a low-latency lightweight publish/subscribe (pub/sub) system for IOT services, we propose an efficient and scalable broker architecture, called Grid Quorum-based pub/sub system (GQPS). As a core component in the event-driven SOA framework for IOT services, this architecture organizes multiple pub/sub brokers into a quorum-based peer-to-peer topology for efficient topic searching. It also leverages a topic searching algorithm and a caching strategy to achieve a small and constant search latency. Lightweight RESTful interfaces make our GQPS more suitable for IOT services. Cost analysis and experiment study demonstrate that GQPS achieves a significant performance gain in search satisfaction without compromising search cost. We applied GQPS in the District Heating Control and Information Service System in Beijing, China, which validates the feasibility and availability of our architecture.

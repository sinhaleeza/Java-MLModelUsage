In this paper we describe JClarens; a Java based implementation of the Clarens remote data server. JClarens provides Web services for an interactive analysis environment to dynamically access and analyze the tremendous amount of data scattered across various locations. Additionally this research is aimed to develop a service oriented grid enabled portal (GEP) that provides interface and access to several grid services to give a homogeneous and optimized view of the distributed and heterogeneous environment. Other than showing platform independent behavior provided by Java, the use of XML-RPC based Web services enabled JClarens to be a language neutral server and demonstrated interoperability with its Python variant. Extreme care has been taken in the usage and manipulation of various Java libraries to cater the needs of high performance computing. The overall exercise has yielded in a prototype with strong emphasis on security and virtual organization management (VOM). This shall provide a common platform to support development of larger, more flexible framework with future aims to integrate it with a loosely coupled, decentralized, and autonomous framework for grid enabled analysis environment (GAE).

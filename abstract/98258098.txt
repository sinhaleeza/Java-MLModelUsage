The increasing ubiquity of wireless mobile devices is promoting unprecedented levels of electronic collaboration among devices interoperating to achieve a common goal. Issues related to host interoperability are addressed partially by the service-oriented computing paradigm. However, certain technical concerns relating to reliable interactions among hosts in ad hoc networks have not yet received much attention. We introduce follow-me sessions, where interactions occur between a client and a service, rather than a specific provider or server. We allow the client to switch service providers, if needed. We exploit strategies involving the use of contextual information, strong process migration, context-sensitive binding, and location-agnostic communication protocols. We show how follow-me sessions mitigate issues related to proxy-based service-oriented architectures in ad hoc networks.

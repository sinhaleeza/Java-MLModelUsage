This paper presents a structural model and an infrastructure for resource management and service discovering in SOA. The structural model is composed by a set of metaclasses which allow representation and descriptions of services, as well as different types of service components and granularities for composition and reuse. The model includes procedures to find and retrieve candidates to build composite services for meeting specific needs and purposes. Candidate services are found and retrieved by means of intelligent discovery mechanisms on the basis of a set of descriptors. The discovery procedure adopts a Case-Based Reasoning approach, in which the services are considered as cases that are kept and indexed in a repository.

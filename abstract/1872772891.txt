Selection of existing services for agile Web application design offers many advantages, namely, the availability of widespread solutions in the form of data and services shared over the Web, and reduced development costs. In this paper, we propose a framework to support service selection, where a Web application developer takes into account choices made by other developers to learn from them in selecting suitable services. To this aim, we weight as more important the choices made by developers who present a larger number of followers in a network of social relationships. Such a network is used to compute developers' rank to support service selection.

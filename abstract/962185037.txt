Most of trustworthy web service selection simply focus on individual reputation and ignore the collaboration reputation between services. To enhance the collaboration trust during web service selection, a reputation model called collaboration reputation is proposed. The reputation model is built on web service collaboration network(WSCN), which is constructed in terms of the composite service execution log. Thus, the WSCN aims to maintain the trustworthy collaboration alliance among web services, In WSCN, the collaboration reputation can be assessed by two metrics, one called invoking reputation is computed by recommendation, which is selected from the community structure hiding in WSCN, the other is assessed by the invoked web service. In addition, the web service selection based on WSCN is designed.

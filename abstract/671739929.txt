The word "Web X.o" represents "Web eXpandoo" which is derived from "Web" and a misspelled word "Expandnoon". "noon" is interpreted as "the highest, brightest, or finest point or part" or "the highest point". This paper introduces some basic features of Web X.o that expands the current Web to the "highest and brightest" point. The key concept of Services HyperChain in the Web eXpandoo framework is introduced to provide an enabling technology architecture that supports the future Web, which coordinates multimedia presentations, human interactions, business processes, computing resources, and business applications in a uniform fashion. Today's Web 2.0 technologies are mainly dealing with the presentation and community-based interaction aspects in the Web X.o framework. The boundary among Web, desktop applications, and backend resources are removed by creating Services HyperChain in the Web eXpandoo framework. The IEEE Body of Knowledge on Services Computing system is used as a prototype to illustrate how the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web 2.0 technologies are used to to realize the Services HyperChain with unified services resource and services ecosystem enablement architecture of Web X.o.

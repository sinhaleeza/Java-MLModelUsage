The synchronized air power management (SAPM) initiative is a collaborative USAF, government, and industry effort. XML Web services were employed to integrate Air Force battle management command, control, and communications (BMC3) systems regardless of their operating environments (J2EE, Windows .NET) and hardware platforms (Unix, Microsoft Windows), and to integrate BMC3 systems with enterprise workflow engines. SAPM enhances visibility into the process of planning, scheduling, and executing missions, and streamlines BMC3 operations, demonstrating a drastic reduction in the time it takes to plan, evaluate, and execute decisions, as well as a reduction in associated manpower needs.

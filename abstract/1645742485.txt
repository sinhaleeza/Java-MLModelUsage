The rapid growth in the number and diversity of Mashup services, coupled with the myriad of functionally similar Mashup services, makes it difficult to find suitable Mashup services to develop Mashup-based software applications due to an unprecedentedly large number of choices of Mashup services. Even if the existing latent factor based methods show significant improvements in Mashup service clustering and discovery, it is still challenging to find Mashup services with high accuracy due to overlooking of relationships among Mashup services. The relationships among Mashup services actually can be exploited in mining latent functional factors to improve the accuracy of clustering and discovery. In this paper, we propose a Mashup service clustering method based on an integration of service content and network via exploiting a two-level topic model. This method, firstly designs a two-level topic model to mine latent topics for representing functional features of Mashup services. Secondly, it uses two different random walk processes to derive and incorporate the topic distribution of Mashup services at service network level into the topic distribution of Mashup services at the service content level. Thirdly, K-means and Agnes algorithm are used to perform Mashup service clustering based on latent topics' similarity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to measure performance of our method. Compared with other existing clustering approaches, experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, purity and entropy.

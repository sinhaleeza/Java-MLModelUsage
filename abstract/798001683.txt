Many enterprises have a growing interest in service composition to construct their business applications. With the increase of alternative services, Quality of Service (QoS) becomes an important indicator of obtaining optimal composite services. Due to the dynamic nature of the service environment, a composite service may not guarantee to deliver an overall optimal QoS. Re-optimization approaches have been developed to handle a dynamic environment. However, these approaches do not consider the diversity of alternative solutions, which may lead to better solutions. In this work, we introduce an adaptive approach, called estimation of distribution algorithm based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine (rEDA). rEDA effectively maintains the diversity of alternative solutions, by leveraging the inference ability of Restricted Boltzmann Machine to capture the potential solutions. It also provides a predictive guidance for the exploration of solution space, by considering the degree of how well a service contributes to the global QoS. The experimental evaluation shows that rEDA has a significant improvement on effectiveness and efficiency over existing approaches.

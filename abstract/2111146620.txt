To meet the demand for rapid Web-service development, developers seek to efficiently consume existing data from multiple sources into a form that can be used by the new service. In this paper, we discuss our SAKURA prototype in which we created two services to facilitate such data consumption. The first, a “resource-aggregation” service, gives developers a “composed object” abstraction across multiple Web-services. The second, a “business object” caching service, improves the performance of accessing existing Web-services from the new application. We describe these two services and illustrate their benefits in the context of an extended scenario.

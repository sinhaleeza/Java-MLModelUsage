This intense and unique tutorial provides a direct, step-by-step walkthrough of the key factors and considerations for migrating an organization from its current state to a service-oriented architecture. It discusses key areas of concern that should be addressed in this transformation process from current to future state. The identification, modeling and design of appropriate services at a proper level of granularity that are business aligned and leverage IT systems is a key issue addressed by a Service-oriented Analysis and Design. Thus, in the second part of this tutorial we provide a step-by-step introduction to Service-oriented Analysis and Design using the SOMA (service-oriented modeling and architecture) method [1]. Using this method in conjunction with key web services standards and tools, we present a set of concrete process steps that lead to the realization of an SOA.

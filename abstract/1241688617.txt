The target of grid monitoring and management is to monitor services in the grid for fault detection, performance analysis, performance tuning, load balancing and scheduling. This paper introduces the design and implementation of a WSLA-based grid monitoring and management system - GSMon. In GSMon, we use a service-oriented architecture, give monitoring information of the grid service a unique format by using WSLA and develop extended modules in the OGSA container. GSMon conforms to grid service and Web service standards and uses dynamic deployment technology to solve the problem of monitoring new grid services. It is a novel infrastructure for grid monitoring and management with high flexibility and scalability.

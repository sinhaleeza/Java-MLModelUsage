Web services aim to support efficient integration of applications over Web. Most Web services are stateful, such as services for business processes, and they converse with each other via properly ordered interactions, instead of individual unrelated invocations. In order to address efficient integration of conversational Web services, we create a unified specification model for both conversation protocol and composition; we propose methods to integrate a partner service with complex conversation protocol into a composition of Web services; assure the correctness of composition by formal verification. The mapping between our model and BPEL4WS is also discussed.

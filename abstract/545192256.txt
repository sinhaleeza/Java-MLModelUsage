In this work, we present a framework for the semantic composition of web services based on Statecharts and uniform community service descriptions. Our model is a two step process. In the first step, we derive the execution model of the user's query. The execution model is specified in Statecharts formalism; whereas the user's query is described in OWL-S. Therefore, a mapping from Statecharts formalism to OWL-S is developed. In the second step, we instantiate the developed execution model through invocation of available e-services instances. Hence, and a result, we obtain an execution plan (said also strategy) satisfying user constraints. The key features of the proposed framework could be summarized as follows. First, unlike other existing languages, using OWL-S enables the semantic description of e-services. These semantics are taken into consideration in our composition strategy. Second, the user constraints (or preferences) are taken into account during composition and are expressed as a finite set of logical formulas with the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) language.

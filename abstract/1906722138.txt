caBIGtrade (the cancer Biomedical Informatics Gridtrade) is an open-source, open-access information network enabling cancer researchers to share tools, data, applications, and technologies. caGrid is the underlying service-based grid software infrastructure for caBIG, integrating distributed data and analytic resources into a virtual collaborative platform for cancer research. Within caGrid, many cancer-related data analysis and aggregation tasks can make use of "canned" sets of service invocations, or workflows. As a result, there is a need to orchestrate the invocation of caGrid services through the use of both a workflow language and tooling. In this paper, we first explain why we select Taverna as a candidate for workflow authoring and invocation. We then review the development of Taverna plug-ins in general, and describe how we extend Taverna to use caGrid services. We then detail a real-world example and the lessons learned from our research. Finally we conclude with a summary and a description of potential next steps.

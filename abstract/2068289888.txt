In order to encourage the growth and take-up in the mobile commerce (mC), trust must be embedded as a core value of mobile products. The future product is likely to evolve within a fast-growing and socially conscious ecology. Product that works with the way people use their phones will develop in a collaborative social network. Providing social networking will facilitate mobile data network for free, and the ecology of soft-product will allow trust in the mC process. In order that this can be effective, a change in the mC supply-chain model would be require. This paper examines an existing model for charging and billing of mobile soft-product and a Mobile Open Billing Gateway (MOPB) model based on the triangle of B2B and B2C was proposed, with the linkage of trust, and compares a sample range of existing product with possible new mobile product. The question posed by this paper 'Is the ecology of mobile product for mC possible'?.

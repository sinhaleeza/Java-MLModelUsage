With the proliferation of fairly powerful mobile devices and ubiquitous wireless technology, we see a transformation from traditional mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) into a new era of service-oriented MANETs wherein a node can provide and receive services. Requested services must be decomposed into more abstract services and then bound; we formulate this as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem to minimize the service cost, while maximizing the quality of service and quality of information in the service a user receives. The MOO problem is an SP-to-service assignment problem. We propose a multidimensional trust based algorithm to solve the problem. We carry out an extensive suite of simulations to test the relative performance of the proposed trust-based algorithm against a non-trust-based counterpart and an existing single-trust-based beta reputation scheme. Our proposed algorithm effectively filters out malicious nodes exhibiting various attack behaviors by penalizing them with loss of reputation, which ultimately leads to high user satisfaction. Further, our proposed algorithm is efficient with linear runtime complexity while achieving a close-to-optimal solution.

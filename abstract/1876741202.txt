Modeling with graphical notations is characterized by a wide range of notations, stakeholders, and tools. In the course of this paper, a generic web-based model encoding and editing protocol is outlined to introduce a novel approach to modeling utilizing open web standards only. It eases tool integration, aids collaborative model editing and is ultimately supported by browser-based editing environments.

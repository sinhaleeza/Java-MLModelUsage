This paper presents a short survey on the quality evaluation of web services. The most popular metrics for estimating such quality and user perception of web services are Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE), which represent objective and subjective assessments correspondingly. For different types of web services, the values of QoS and QoE are measured in different ways. In this paper, we consider various definitions of QoS based on web service parameters and describe several methods for evaluating QoS and QoE. We start with experimental evaluation of QoS based on network traffic analysis and further turn to model based methods for QoS estimating. Existing relationships between different kinds of service quality evaluation are also discussed.

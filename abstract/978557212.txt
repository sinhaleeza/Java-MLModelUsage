Smart Home solutions are currently booming and apply to a variety of areas in order to improve inhabitants' quality of life. Many Smart Home solutions are based on service-oriented pervasive platforms providing context services. These services may correspond to devices (a lamp for instance) or to any computing unit providing useful functions (luminosity in a room for example). One of the big issues today is that applications running on top of such platforms share services, which can lead to conflicts if acting in incompatible ways. In this paper, we present an approach to manage conflicts in service-oriented pervasive platforms based on locking mechanisms installed at the context level. Our approach is optimistic and addresses conflicts at runtime before their undesired effects occur. This approach is developed and integrated in the iCASA pervasive platform.

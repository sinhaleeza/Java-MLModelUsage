Given that the number of ready-to-use web services is steadily growing, services will provide solutions to a vast range of business problems in the future. And thanks to findings in end-user development research, popular service integration platforms such as IFTTT and Zapier emerged, making process automation as easy as never before. This progress will affect software engineering increasingly: as fewer code is programmed, the more activities like identifying and connecting suitable services using integration platforms become prominent. To explore what it is like to engineer software without writing code, we conducted a workshop with experienced software engineers. With the objective of implementing a simple business process by integrating existing services in a mashup, we collected all lessons learned during that workshop and report them in this paper. Based on that experience, we introduce three different levels of integration and outline a software process model containing specific activities for engineering of service mashups.

CAPTCHA challenges are used all over the Internet to prevent automated scripts from spamming web services. However, recent technological developments have rendered the conventional CAPTCHA insecure and inconvenient to use. In this paper, we propose vCAPTCHA, a voice-based CAPTCHA system that would: (1) enable more secure human authentication, (2) more conveniently integrate with modern devices accessing web services, and (3) help collect vast amounts of annotated speech data for different languages, accents, and dialects that are under-represented in the current speech corpora, thus making speech technologies accessible to more people around the world. vCAPTCHA requires users to speak their responses, in order to unlock or use different web services, instead of typing them. These user responses are analyzed to determine if they were indeed naturally produced, and transcribed to ensure that they contain the challenge sentence. We build a prototype for vCAPTCHA in order to assess its performance and practicality. Our preliminary results show that we are able to achieve an attack success rate as low as 2.3% while maintaining a human success rate comparable to current CAPTCHAs, on ASVspoof datasets.

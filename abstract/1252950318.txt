BPEL(Business Process Execution Language) composite service evolves a lot in its lifetime. Regression testing must be performed to ensure the correctness of each evolved version. In this article, an approach is proposed to select test cases for regression testing based on data flow testing criterion. With XCFG(eXtended Control Flow Graph) modeling BPEL composite service, the approach improves the traditional data flow analysis to compute the def-use pairs in BPEL process, and then identifies the affected def-use pairs by comparing the def-use pairs and XCFG model in the evolved version with those in the baseline version, where related WSDL(Web Service Description Language) documents are incorporated for comparison. The data flow paths covering the affected def-use pairs are calculated for regression testing, and some of them can reuse the test cases in the baseline version, which are determined by analyzing the path condition of data flow paths between two versions. The proposed approach can detect three kinds of changes, including process change, binding change and interface change. Experimental study shows the effectiveness.

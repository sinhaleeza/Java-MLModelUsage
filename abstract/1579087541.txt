With the wide adoption of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), a massive amount of innovative applications emerge in the Internet. One of the popular representations is mashup. It is a new application created by combining different kinds of services. There exist multiple typed objects (e.g., mashup, service, category, tag, provider and description) and relations (e.g., compose and composed by relation between mashups and services, provide and provided by relation between services and providers), which constitute a heterogeneous information network (HIN) naturally. Several approaches already exist for recommending services for users but they are limited to consider only one or two kinds of relations between mashups and services. To apply the rich semantics and enhance recommendation performance, in this paper, we propose a Factorization Machine based service Recommendation approach, called FMRec, on HIN. Specifically, we firstly apply counting-based similarities for meta paths to capture the multiple semantic meanings between mashups and services. And then, we employ matrix factorization to the similarity matrices built by different kinds of meta paths to obtain the mashup latent features and service latent features. Finally, we leverage factorization machine model with a group lasso regularization term to learn the ratings between mashups and services. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset, indicating that our proposed service recommendation approach significantly improves the quality of the recommendation results compared with existing methods.

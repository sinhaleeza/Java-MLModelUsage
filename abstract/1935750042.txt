In this paper, we present an approach to enable access control for semantic Web services. Our approach builds on the idea of autonomous granting of access rights, decision making based on independent trust structures and respects privacy requirements of the users. Our framework allows the specification and computation of complex access control policies in a manageable and efficient way. Therefore, our approach is useful not only in Web services based applications (typically client-server architecture) but also in peer-to-peer and agent-based applications.

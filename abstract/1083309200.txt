WS-BPEL processes are usually overlapped in large Business applications composed of several Web Services. Such applications are more and more developed with respect of quality processes. Testability is an important quality degree, which evaluates the fault detection coverage during the testing process and the testing cost. In this paper, we focus on a well-known testability criterion called observability, which evaluates if enough distinguishable events can be observed while testing. We study the observability of ABPEL (Abstract-BPEL) specifications and we describe some ABPEL observability degradation properties. From these, we propose some observability enhancement methods which detect observability issues in ABPEL specifications and semi-automatically update the ABPEL code.

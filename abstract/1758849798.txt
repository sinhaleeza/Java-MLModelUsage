Wireless Web services, also called mobile services or M-services, provide access to Web services through wireless networks. In this paper, we propose novel access methods and multi-channel organization for mobile users to effectively access composite M-services in wireless broadcast networks. We define a few semantics for accessing broadcast based M-services and study their impact on access efficiency.

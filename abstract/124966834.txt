Service Oriented Computing (SOC) has initially developed for the Internet, but also identified as an appealing computing paradigm for developing applications in distributed wireless environments. The open nature of wireless medium may expose services to a variety of unauthorized third parties (eavesdroppers), resulting in insecure service interactions, while cooperative jamming is promising to provide a strong form of security. This paper focuses on security performance study of wireless communications for service interactions among different parties in SOC. More specifically, this paper establishes a theoretical framework for the study of eavesdropper-tolerance capability (i.e., the maximum number of eavesdroppers that can be tolerated) in a two-hop wireless network, where the cooperative jamming is adopted to ensure security defined by secrecy outage probability (SOP) and opportunistic relaying is adopted to guarantee reliability defined by transmission outage probability (TOP). For the concerned network, exact modeling for SOP and fine approximation for TOP are first conducted based on the Central Limit Theorem. With the help of SOP and TOP models and also the Stochastic Ordering Theory, the model for eavesdropper-tolerance capability analysis is then developed. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our theoretical framework as well as the eavesdropper-tolerance capability of the concerned network from adopting cooperative jamming and opportunistic relaying.

We present a general model, called the Query/IndexLink (QIL) model, for studying unstructured peer-to-peer search networks. QIL aims at providing a simple framework for visualizing and analyzing P2P search networks. QIL introduces the memorizing mechanism into the model, and improves the syntax of the former model. It is a more general and simpler model, which makes analyzing P2P search networks easier.

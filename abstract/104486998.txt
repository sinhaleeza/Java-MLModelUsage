The ability to build new (complex) services by composing existing services is one of the key benefits of the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm. Existing approaches to automate composition requires pre-planning or prediction of the number of required services, making them unsuitable in dynamic composition scenarios. To address this gap, we present a consistency-based service composition approach, where composition problems are modeled in a generative constraint-based formalism. We illustrate how the configuration of service processes differs from established constraint-based configuration techniques and develop an algorithm to synthesis valid service process compositions. We also show that our technique scales well to non-trivial problems.

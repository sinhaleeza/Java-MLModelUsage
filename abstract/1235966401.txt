In this paper, we introduce Web service application session services, WS-session, for Web service based application session management in communication. A two-way Web service framework is described. It supports the use of Web service in the situation of telecommunication where the communication endpoint can be both a client and a peer-to-peer server. We describe the interface design in two-way Web service interaction based on the concept of tightly coupled interface and loosely coupled interface solutions. The proposed approach provides full support of asynchronous outbound operations and event notifications in communication services. It is implemented in a research prototype system that provides both standard based (ECMA-348) services and Avaya service extensions. In addition, we investigated the integration of our proposed approach with BPEL4WS. It allows the user to create new services through a drag-n-drop based service creation environment (ECLIPSE/BPEL4WS). It leads to a paradigm of service creation through Web service composition. More sophisticated telecommunication services are created from composing the basic services.

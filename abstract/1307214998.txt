In this paper, we present a framework for evaluating the QoE of a service that includes functional and non-functional service requirements. Non-functional requirements are classified into objective, subjective, and business parameters that affect Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), and Quality of Business (QoBiz), correspondingly. As those metrics have a strong dependency between each other, we discuss how the QoE of a web-based Over-The-Top service (OTT) can be evaluated taking into account subjective, objective and business parameters. The functional service behavior is described by an Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) in which non-functional objective, subjective and business-related parameters are tracked using context variables and corresponding updating functions. These parameters are used to evaluate the QoE of the service. We show that the corresponding model allows to keep a track of a user-service interaction. Moreover, the model of the service integrates subjective, objective and business parameters, and thus, can be applied to the QoE evaluation of any OTT service.

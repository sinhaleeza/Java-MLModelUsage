Logs, which record valuable system runtime information, have been widely employed in Web service management by service providers and users. A typical log analysis based Web service management procedure is to first parse raw log messages because of their unstructured format; and then apply data mining models to extract critical system behavior information, which can assist Web service management. Most of the existing log parsing methods focus on offline, batch processing of logs. However, as the volume of logs increases rapidly, model training of offline log parsing methods, which employs all existing logs after log collection, becomes time consuming. To address this problem, we propose an online log parsing method, namely Drain, that can parse logs in a streaming and timely manner. To accelerate the parsing process, Drain uses a fixed depth parse tree, which encodes specially designed rules for parsing. We evaluate Drain on five real-world log data sets with more than 10 million raw log messages. The experimental results show that Drain has the highest accuracy on four data sets, and comparable accuracy on the remaining one. Besides, Drain obtains 51.85%~81.47% improvement in running time compared with the state-of-the-art online parser. We also conduct a case study on an anomaly detection task using Drain in the parsing step, which determines the effectiveness of Drain in log analysis.

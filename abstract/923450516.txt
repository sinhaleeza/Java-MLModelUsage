As a kind of tamper resistant hardware, Java Card is regarded as a trusted third party that can operate safely on an untrusting host. At the same time, with the development of e-commerce, network management and mobile agent technology, multimobile agents' cooperation can not only improve the efficiency of distributed compute, but more importantly, it has a comprehensive applicative value in solving the security issues of mobile agent system. Aiming at settling the bottleneck of Java Card on mobile agents' congestion, this paper, proposes a multimobile agents' separation scheme in destination host. By a specific example, the paper analyzes the detailed process of this scheme for its security and validity. Furthermore, it provides the architecture of multimobile agents and other applications on how multimobile agents resist attacks primarily from the malicious executing hosts and draws some significant conclusions.

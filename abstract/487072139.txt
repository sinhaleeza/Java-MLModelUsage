From the analysis of some hard drawbacks faced with system service and composite service management today, a novel multi-agent-assisted and WS-management-based composite service management scheme: MWS-MCS is introduced in this paper. Firstly, we propose model architecture of this scheme. The prototype system had proved the feasibility of this design scheme. At last, we conclude this paper and analyze the prospective research challenges.

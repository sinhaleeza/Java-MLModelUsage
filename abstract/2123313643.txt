This paper describes a rule-based framework for business activity management called RuleBAM. It is a novel framework whose objective is to support the requirements of dynamic monitoring and control of business applications using policies and rules. RuleBAM is composed of a customized assemblage of built-time and run-time technologies that include business rules and application modeling tools, code generators, transformation services, rules engines, business integration adaptors and Web services. Business activity management (BAM) polices are used to define the requirements of RuleBAM systems and business rules are exploited as execution platform for BAM policies. Taken as a whole, these form a new method of using business rules to enable business activity management. A case study is also presented in this paper.

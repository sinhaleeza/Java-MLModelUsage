Predictive industrial maintenance promotes proactive scheduling of maintenance to minimize unexpected device faults. A fault is not always isolated and may be formed by a propagation of trivial anomalies, which are regarded as service events herein. In this paper, we firstly propose an algorithm for generating service event correlation. Such correlations can show us lots of clues to the anomaly/fault propagation. The correlations are encapsulated into service hyperlinks as our previous works did, and thus we depict the anomaly/fault propagation as service event routing among services via the refined service hyperlinks. Our scenario illustrates that a trivial anomaly may propagate into different faults under different service event correlations. It indicates that the destination of a service event is often uncertain. Therefore, this paper further proposes a heuristic approach to handle the uncertainty problem. Extensive experiments have been made to verify the effectiveness of the approach.

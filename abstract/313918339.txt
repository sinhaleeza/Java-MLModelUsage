The increasing usage of smart embedded devices is blurring the line between the virtual and real worlds. This creates new opportunities for applications to better integrate the real-world, providing services that are more diverse, highly dynamic and efficient. Service Oriented Architecture is on the verge of extending its applicability from the standard, corporate IT domain to the real-world devices. In such infrastructures, composed of a large number of resource-limited devices, the discovery of services and on demand provisioning of missing functionality is a challenge. This work proposes a process, its architecture and an implementation that enables developers and process designers to dynamically discover, use, and create running instances of real-world services in composite applications.

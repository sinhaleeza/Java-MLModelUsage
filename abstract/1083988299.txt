As business processes continue to gain relevance in different domains, dynamicity is becoming a great concern. Static processes no longer cover the actual needs of constantly changing environments, and process adaptation is a must in order to maintain competitive levels. While creating dynamically adaptable business processes can be a challenging task, undoing these adaptations is a natural functionality that has not been studied in depth. Straight forward approaches for unadaptation can easily end up with corrupted processes, bringing uncertainty to the whole business logic. In this paper we bring forward a solution for efficiently undoing a business process adaptation in event-driven environments, considering also the correlated adaptations that happened afterwards.

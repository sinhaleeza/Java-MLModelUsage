Data validation is one of the most important and, possibly, most under-valued task in an organization. Without clean data, an organization cannot employ sophisticated analysis and optimization tools to strive for excellence in operations, delivery or planning. Organizations have started to realize the value of data and its impact on their efficiency. Typically, they either develop in-house solutions or purchase industry standard solutions. In this work, we propose an alternative of data validation as a service offering. We argue that such a service would be a profitable proposition for both the parties, provider as well as consumer. We present a general framework to enable such an offering. We provide details on one such implementation that we carried to showcase the viability of such an approach. We propose multiple variants of the offering to handle privacy concerns of the consumer. Finally, we present a set of initial results comparing the different variants.

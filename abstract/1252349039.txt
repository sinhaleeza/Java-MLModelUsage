Semantic web service discovery has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade. Research conducted in this area can be (mainly) summarized as follows: (1) "monolith" matchmaking algorithms (and systems), and (2) schema matching-based techniques. In this paper we describe a flexible approach that takes leverage of existing schema matchers, leading to a multiple choice strategy for semantic service discovery. The approach has been implemented and validated in using the data collection provided by the S3 (Semantic Service Selection) community, and led to promising preliminary results.

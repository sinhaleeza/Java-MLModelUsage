This paper reports several key challenges and solutions when we apply Web 2.0 mashup technology to build a university-oriented services portal. A two-layer mashup service model is proposed as the underlying basis to support multiple granularities of services mashup. We explore a caching technique to facilitate personalizable services requests. We also report our preliminary practice of exploiting Facebook as a social relationship data source.

As primarily modular and distributed architectures, service-oriented architectures may impose new challenges in software evolution. Since web services evolve independently, this may cause disruptions to the proper function of consuming software. In this paper, we present \wsd, an Eclipse plug-in to support the evolution of service clients, including (a) identifying the differences between two service versions, (b) automatically adapting the client application to the new version, and (c) testing the client to confirm it functions properly.

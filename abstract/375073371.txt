Currently, workflow systems are either XML based or component based. Both paradigms have usability deficiencies. XML is not designed for procedural programming. Legacy code is difficult to adapt to component based systems. We propose a new paradigm by adding workflow keywords to an existing high-level language. This approach, called GroupSpeak, uses a procedural style of programming and allows for easy introduction of workflow patterns to legacy code. The programmer can leverage their existing knowledge of the high-level language to easily add workflow capabilities to their applications.

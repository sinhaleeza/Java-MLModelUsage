In recent years, due to the growth of information on the internet, the number of available Web services has increased. Clustering Web services based on their functional features to different domains have started to play a major role in several service management tasks such as efficient Web service discovery and recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology-based approach for Web service clustering. Instead of using traditional methods, we focus on the similarity and specificity of terms for ontology generation. The amount of domain-specific information included in a term is used to define the specificity of that term. Specific terms are more powerful than general terms for describing a large amount of domain information. Taking advantage of this, we generate a new ontology, which is then used to calculate similarity by defining new logic-based filters. When the similarity calculation fails, we apply information retrieval-based methods. Based on a comprehensive evaluation that we conducted to measure the performance of our method, our novel clustering approach was shown to be more effective in terms of precision, recall, Fmeasure, purity and entropy than other existing clustering approaches.

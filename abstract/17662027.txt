Complex adaptive systems are dynamically assembled systems characterized by multiple competing stakeholders, fluid requirements, emergent behavior, and susceptibility to external pressures that can cause change across the entire system. This paper shows how key principles of complex systems engineering can support achieving net centric operations (NCO) for the DoD. We discuss approaches to on-demand data, an IT infrastructure strategy based on Web service and semantic Web technologies, as well as guidance and initial observations on spiral development and management using Communities of Interest combined with a Developer's Environment.

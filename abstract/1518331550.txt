Web service recommendation has recently drawn much attention with the growing amount of Web services. Previous work usually exploits the collaborative filtering techniques for Web service recommendation, but suffers from the data sparsity problem that leads to inaccurate results. Our analysis on a real-world Quality of Service (QoS) dataset shows that there is a hidden correlation among users and services. We define such hidden correlation with an asymmetric matrix (namely asymmetric correlation), in which each entry presents the hidden correlation between a user pair or between a service pair. The goal of this work is to employ such asymmetric correlation among users and services to alleviate the data sparsity problem and further enhance the prediction accuracy in service recommendation. Specifically, we propose an asymmetric correlation regularized matrix factorization (MF) framework, in which asymmetric correlation and asymmetric correlation propagation have been naturally integrated. Finally, experimental results on a well-known real-world QoS dataset validate that the use of asymmetric correlation among users and services is effective in improving prediction accuracy for Web service recommendation.

With the wide availability of products and services through popular e-commerce platforms and dozens of similar offerings to choose from, there is a need to accurately assess and evaluate the quality of offerings. Several studies have shown that consumer feedback is an important source of information. This paper presents: (a) consumer Rating as a Service (RaaS) -- a building block service that can be used to add the consumer feedback lifecycle feature in the development of e-commerce platforms, (b) an approach to evaluate the quality of composite offerings based on the aggregation of consumer ratings using the composition structure and component relationships. Benefits of the proposed service include reduced development effort, shorter delivery time and a fine-grained aggregation of consumer ratings for composite offerings even with limited ratings.

Despite the success of orchestration and choreography for Web services composition, there are still challenges to be overcome such as the difficulty for management of complex control-flow executions, the communication cost associated with service interactions, knowledge of the business process by services and even their compatibility in compositions. As an alternative to traditional approaches, in this paper we focus on an important face of Web services compositions that is the management of control-flow executions and propose the use of WED-flow approach, in which the execution of business processes is driven by changes in data states. In our approach, the control-flow is not a requirement but a consequence of Web services execution, providing greater flexibility for the development and maintenance of applications. The first contribution of this work is the evaluation of possible scenarios for orchestration and choreography. The second contribution is the implementation and validation of WED-flow approach for Web services execution for these possible scenarios.

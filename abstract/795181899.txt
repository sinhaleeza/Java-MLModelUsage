Recent years have witnessed the development of Cloud Computing. The management of images is a big problem in virtualized environment because there are quantities of Virtual Machine images being stored in a Cloud and most of them are outdated. How to detect the outdated images and patch them efficiently? In this paper, we present a prototype called OPS- Offline Patching Scheme for the Images Management in a Secure Cloud Environment. In OPS, we can detect out the outdated image quickly by a module called Collector. Then a module called Patcher will patch the outdated images. In order to patch an image efficiently, offline patching technology is considered. For the large number of images in the Cloud, parallel scheme is also used. Our experiment results show that OPS can update numerous images efficiently.

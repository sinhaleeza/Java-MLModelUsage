Performance analysis of Web applications are rather difficult since people can perform parts of an activity outside the application or get interrupted while performing an activity in the system. The lack of a performance model makes it hard to plan resources or get a better understanding of the way available resources are used. In this paper an approach for determining a performance model for semi-structured processes is applied to a case study.

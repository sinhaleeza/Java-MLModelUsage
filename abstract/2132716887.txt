We propose a comprehensive framework for adaptivity of service-based applications, which exploits the concept of process fragments as a way to model reusable process knowledge and to allow for the dynamic, incremental, context-aware composition of such fragments into adaptable service-based applications. The framework provides a set of adaptation mechanisms that, combined through adaptation strategies, are able to solve complex adaptation problems. An implementation of the proposed solution is presented and evaluated on a real world scenario from the logistics domain.

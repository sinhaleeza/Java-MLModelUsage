Service-based software systems (SBSSs) are widely deployed due to the growing trend of distributed computing and cloud computing. It is important to ensure high quality of an SBSS, especially in a strongly competitive market. Existing works on SBSS reliability usually assumed independence of service failures. However, the fact that resource sharing exists in different levels of SBSS operations invalidates this assumption. Ignorance of failure dependencies have been discussed as potentially affecting system reliability predictions and lowering the benefits of design diversity, as typically seen in high-reliability systems. In this paper, we propose a reliability framework that incorporates failure dependence modeling, system reliability modeling, as well as reliability analysis for individual services and for failure sources. The framework is also capable of analyzing the internal structures of popular software fault tolerant (FT) schemes. The proposed method is applied to a travel agency system based upon a real-world practice for verifying its accuracy of reliability modeling and effectiveness of varied reliability measures. The results show that failure dependence of the services is an essential factor for analyzing any valuable SBSS system. Further, a set of reliability measures with different capabilities and complexities are available for assisting SBSS engineers with system improvements.

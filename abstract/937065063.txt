This paper proposes a feature-oriented approach for Web services customization that can address three key challenges: reducing complexity, automated validation and dynamic deployment. We exploit techniques from Software Product Line (SPL) domain, particularly feature modeling techniques, to design our framework. Feature modeling allows to abstract variability in consumers' requirements to simplify customization processes, while automated analysis on feature models helps to validate customizations. The use of feature models at runtime enables dynamic deployment of a business process as a result of a service customization. We propose the use of feature models as service description artifacts to facilitate service customizations. The framework builds on a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach to automate large parts of its operation.

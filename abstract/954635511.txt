Recently, grid and peer-to-peer overlays have attracted attention from research communities as well as industry. However, the overwhelming majority of industrial, commercial and academic activities are geared around applications, servers, and middleware. There have been some efforts in the management of the underlying networks (the connectivity for the overlays), but far from enough. This paper proposes a resilient, fault-adaptive, overlay resource management framework, with lightweight state management infrastructure, taken from some ongoing work by the authors in this area. This research aims to solve the problems of: (a) managing distributed network resources in a decentralized way; (b) providing resilient QoS for highly dynamic networks.

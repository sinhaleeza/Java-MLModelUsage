Businesses are, nowadays, keen on organizing their business processes in the most flexible way, as to cope with the tough competition. Two major concerns are emerging, while dealing with the construction of new process functionalities: (1) shortening the development periods, and (2) managing the privacy risks. An effective solution for dealing with both concerns, consists of reusing fragments of existing business processes. These fragments need to be declared as safe, however, from a privacy perspective. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach for decomposing existing business processes into reusable fragments, that are privacy-aware; i.e., these fragments do not allow the disclosure of so-called sensitive associations.

In a composite service for multiple users, users that locate in the different network position are related to network parameters that change dynamically. Therefore, we need a service composition method that can not only handle many user requests, but also adapt to the change of the current network parameters. We use queuing theory and reliability theory to model services, and propose a runtime service composition method. The method obtains multiple service execution paths for each kind of user requests, and chooses the proper candidate service in runtime according to the current network state. The results show that our method is effective and can adapt to the changes of the network parameters.

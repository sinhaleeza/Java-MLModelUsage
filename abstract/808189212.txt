The business process execution language (BPEL) is a language to orchestrate web services into a single business process. In a choreography view, several processes are interconnected and their interaction behavior is described from a global perspective. This paper shows how BPEL can be extended for defining choreographies. The proposed extensions (BPEL4Chor) distinguish between three aspects: (i) participant behavior descriptions, i.e. control flow dependencies in each participant, (ii) the participant topology, i.e. the existing participants and their interconnection using message links and (iii) participant groundings, i.e. concrete configurations for data formats and port types. As BPEL itself is used unchanged, the extensions facilitate a seamless integration between service choreographies and orchestrations. The suitability of the extensions is validated by assessing their support for the Service Interaction Patterns.

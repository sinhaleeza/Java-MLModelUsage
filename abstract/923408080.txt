Research on Web Services and Services Computing began shortly after the start of the new millennium and with the first major research conference on the subject, the International Conference on Web Services, starting in 2003. Due to the new and practical utility of Web service technology, many researchers began to work in this field. New ideas, applications and related technologies continue to invigorate this discipline. This special issue of IEEE Transactions on Services Computing considers four such topics that lead to “Advances in Web Services Research”: Cloud Services; Polices and Agreements; Services Engineering; and Service/Process Mining. It consists of the best extended papers from the two premier research conferences on services computing: the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services and the 2015 IEEE Conference on Services Computing.

In a business process execution language (BPEL) process definition the sequence of exchanged messages typically originates from the sequence of business process activities and from the need of coordination of those activities across the participants of the process. As such business concerns (e.g. the sequence of business process steps) are of en mixed with technical aspects (e.g. the sequence of coordination messages). In this article we present an architecture to separate business and technical concerns, which results in a clearer overview of the high-level business process and improves the flexibility and maintainability of the orchestration architecture. The described architecture depends on existing Web service standards. Different eventing and coordination specifications are discussed. The ultimate architecture is mainly based on the WS-Brokered Notification and WS-Coordination framework specifications.

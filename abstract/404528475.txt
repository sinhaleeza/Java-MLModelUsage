The next generation intelligent devices need to grow and evolve with the user. Mobile user framework solution allows us to move towards this goal. In this paper, we describe a service framework that captures user's interest and intent which is mined through latent analysis of content. Applications using such a framework can provide adaptive and customized services to the user. We provide details of four demonstrator applications that use this framework, utilizing user interest and intent information to provision targeted advertisements, recommend products and songs. We provide details of our evaluation with subjective and objective analysis of the system.

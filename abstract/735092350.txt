Service Level Agreement (SLA) establishment can be viewed as a cross-organizational business process, in which consumers and providers, with varying and potentially conflicting requirements and capabilities, interact with one another in order to try and reach common agreements over the service usage terms and conditions. These interactions are governed by public interaction protocols which define their communicative behaviour, and are guided by private decision making strategies which define their strategic behaviour. In this paper, we propose a novel policy-based approach for orchestrating SLA establishment that enables a loose, run-time coupling between these two behaviours, resulting in a more flexible and adaptive automated SLA establishment process. We have implemented our approach by extending the AutoSLAM middleware [2][3][4] and validated it through a real-world use case scenario of procuring computing resources from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

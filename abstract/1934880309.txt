Mapping XML document schemas and Web service interfaces to programming languages has an important role in effective creation of quality Web service implementations. This paper presents a novel way to map XML data to the C++ programming language with emphasis on use in mobile and embedded systems. The proposed solution offers more flexibility and more compact code that is critical in embedded environments. The paper describes the concept and the architecture of the solution and compares it with existing solutions

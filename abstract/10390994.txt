With the development of Web Services, a phenomenon of multiple users request for one service simultaneously has become more and more popular. To address the challenges of service selection for multi-users' requirements, we propose an interval number based service selection method (INSSM). We firstly propose a practical method for expression of users' requirements with multiple dimensional interval numbers. Secondly, we partition candidates into neighboring service sets based on hierarchical clustering. Thirdly, we compute matching degree between neighboring service sets and users' requirements. Finally, we select an appropriate service according to the matching degree results and load degree. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can not only make use of service resources more effectively but also avoid service overload more significantly compared with other existing methods.

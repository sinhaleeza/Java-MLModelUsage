UDDI registries are intended to become the world-wide lookup mechanism for Web-services. As such, the registry has to provide high throughput, low response times, high availability, and access to accurate data. Replication is often used to satisfy such requirements. Various replication strategies exist, favoring different subsets of the above performance metrics. In this paper we have a closer look at two very different replication strategies. One strategy follows the UDDI specification, the second uses a middleware based replication tool. In this paper, we provide a comparison of these two approaches focusing on performance and ease of integration with an existing UDDI implementation.

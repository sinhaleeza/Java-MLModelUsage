With the widely application of information technology in the coal mining industry, the number of information systems has grown significantly. However, how to take advantage of the information fully from those heterogeneous systems to provide an integrated service has become a barrier to the development of mine. Meanwhile, the scope of the information services in coal mine is so limited that only those managers can enjoy the information and decision supporting services. Because of these above reasons, most of miners can't enjoy the benefits of informatization. Based on the background, a framework of the context-aware-based intelligent service system for miners is proposed for the coal industry in the paper. In order to construct the system, three key technologies are emphasized, i.e. context information modeling, context information reasoning, and business service calling &amp; composition. In the end, a detailed system implementation is given to illustrate how to apply the framework to establish the context-aware-based service system in the coal industry. The result of application is satisfactory.

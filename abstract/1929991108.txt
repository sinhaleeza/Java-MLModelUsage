A dynamic cooperation model for different agents' message exchanging is proposed. It is thought that the curve of surrounding words' relevant influence approximatively fits normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of /spl sigma/. Following those mechanisms, agent-based selective information retrieval based on topical crawling, high-performance indexing and an efficient search algorithm is implemented. The agents' cooperation model expresses the procedure of agent organization and communication. Topical crawling based on anchor word concept analysis can guarantee a higher performance. The topical crawler makes it easy to find as many relevant pages as possible and as few irrelevant pages as possible.

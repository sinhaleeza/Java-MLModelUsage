Every day, the services or composite services satisfy billions of customers' requirements. However, these requirements are not explicit to the service providers, because people always make their decisions randomly or with specific reasons that are not announced directly online. Therefore, digging user interest (portrait) became a trendy measure for Web personalized recommendation. However, user requirement is not only a collection of user interests. It will be more comprehensive, if it contains the mode of user demand occurrence and the trend of user preference evolution. This paper proposes a novel approach based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to elicit the service requirement patterns and detect the individual preference evolution under these patterns. A case study is performed in pharmaceutical retail service market to verify this approach.

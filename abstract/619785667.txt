With the proliferation of positioning technologies and GPS-enabled mobile devices, it has become very important to search for optimal paths to cover required points of interest(POIs, e.g., banks and restaurants) over road networks in many location-based services. In practice, however, traffic conditions are inherently uncertain and dynamically changing overtime, which makes it rather challenging to provide accurate results for path queries based on travelling time. Inspired by this, we considerthe practical settings of road networks and model them by uncertain road networks (URNs) on which the travelling time of each road is uncertain and captured by a set of travelling time samples. Then, we formalize the probabilistic time-constrained path (PTP) query over uncertain road networks to retrieve those paths that not only cover required POIs with constrained service time but also have the minimum travelling times in high confidence. We prove that PTPquery problem is NP-hard. In orderto answer PTPqueries efficiently, we propose an efficient PTPquery approach with effective pruning strategies regarding the time constraints on POIs and the probabilistic/rank requirements of queries. Extensive experiments on real road networks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our PTPquery approach.

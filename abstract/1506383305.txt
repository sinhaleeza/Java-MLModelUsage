Over the last couple of year, the expansion of Web services has grown drastically. In practical applications, many uncertain attributes of Web service change as the complexity of the Web evolves and influence the QoS (quality of service). However, existing matchmaking models and algorithms do not take the uncertain attributes into account, which leads to inaccurately matched results. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware QoS match-making model, UQoSMM, which describes the uncertainty of QoS attributes under different conditions. This paper also proposes a QoS decision making model based on the non-parameter-test, NPTQOS. The decision making model includes a QoS stability comparison algorithm according to the history values of QoS attributes. A prototype has been designed to realize the uncertain attribute-based Web service selection.

Over the past years services computing has become an emerging science that is highly regarded as a necessary technology not only by research but by industry as well. In the same context, the advent of cloud computing gave to services and web applications a whole new perspective and potential. Regardless of the rapid evolution in the fields of services and web technologies, ensuring the QoS of computing resources still remains an important topic. To this end, monitoring computing resources and application execution is an integral part of the services computing value chain. In this paper we present the architectural design and implementation of a service framework that monitors the resources of a physical as well as virtual infrastructure. Our solution extends Nagios, a widely used monitoring toolkit, through the implementation of NEB2REST, a Restful Event Brokering module.

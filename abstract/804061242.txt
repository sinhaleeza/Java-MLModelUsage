Mobile business is becoming a reality due to ubiquitous Internet connectivity, popular mobile devices, and widely available cloud services. However, characteristics of the mobile environment, such as mobility, unpredictability, and variation of mobile network's signal strength, present challenges in selecting optimal services for composition. Traditional QoS-aware methods that select individual services with the best QoS may not always result in the best composite service because constant mobility makes the performance of service invocation unpredictable and location-based. This paper discusses the challenges of this problem and defines it in a formal way. To solve this new research problem, we propose a mobility model, a mobility-aware QoS computation rule, and a mobility-enabled selection algorithm with teaching-learning-based optimization. The experimental simulation results demonstrate that our approach can obtain better solutions than current standard composition methods in mobile environments. The approach can obtain near-optimal solutions and has a nearly linear algorithmic complexity with respect to the problem size.

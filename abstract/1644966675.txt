In Serviced-Oriented Computing (SOC) environments, the trust level of a service or a service provider is a critical issue for a service client to consider, particularly when the client is looking for a service from a large set of services or service providers. However, a service may invoke other services offered by different providers forming composite services. The complex invocation relations significantly increase the complexity of trust evaluation in composite services. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for trust evaluation in composite services that takes all atomic invocations into account, which is essential for composite services selection and discovery.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for specification of invocable semantic Web resources in a unified manner. Our approach enables specification of Web services, composite Web services, Web pages and Web sites with one single process description language in a unified manner. The basic idea behind our work is that different types of invocable Web resources differ mainly in the communication protocol and message formats. The language abstracts from various communication protocols and message formats and hence enables modeling of business logic without worrying much about technical details. Our approach in contrast to existing annotation techniques does not enforce the providers to modify their Web resources.

Semantic Web and heterogeneous data integration are critical factors for the future Web intelligence. A fundamental aspect of this challenge is the provision of a wide and disseminated platform of abstract resources that permit us to get the right information at the right time. We are researching a semantic Web integrated, virtual and dynamic architecture. This paper proposes a Web service architecture as the preliminary implementation guideline for such a semantically integrated one.

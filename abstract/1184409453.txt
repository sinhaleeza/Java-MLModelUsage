Process model improvement is one of the most important challenges to deal with in the field of evolving process-aware information systems. In this paper, we present, PRV, an approach to process model refactoring supporting automatic process model improvement, which enables PAIS to adapt to the varying business requirements. First, a set of change operations preserving soundness is defined to avoid complex verification. Second, an algorithm for process model refactoring based on variants is designed to restructure optimal models automatically. Finally, an extensive set of simulations are performed to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed PRV algorithm.

This paper proposes a novel Web service discovery approach that depend on the mining the underlying semantic structures of interaction interface parameters, which can match interfaces with high precision when the parameters of those interfaces contain meaningful synonyms, abbreviations, and combinations of disordered fragments. Especially, we propose a conceptual Web services description model in which we include the type path for the interaction interface parameters in addition to the traditional text description. Then, based on this description model, we mine the underlying semantics of the interaction interface to create index libraries by clustering interaction interface names and fragments under the supervision of co-occurrence probability. Finally, we propose a Web service Operations Discovery algorithm (OpD) that support the “Single” operations and services with “Composite” operations discovery. The experimental shows that our approach performs better than other approaches in terms of both discovery time and precision.

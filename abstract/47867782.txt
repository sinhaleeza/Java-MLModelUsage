In most Service-Oriented frameworks service selection is based on provider-centric information despite well-known shortcomings (trustworthiness, incompleteness, subjectivity). We propose to allow consumers and third-party modules to extend information about providers and their services directly into the service registry. The knowledge is organized and shared via access controlled groups of interest. Services can be discovered using this knowledge. Our solution is integrated to OSGi and uses the decorator-pattern to make usage transparent.

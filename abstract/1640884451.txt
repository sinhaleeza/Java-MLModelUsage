The information technology has been recognized as one of the most important means to improve health care and curb its ever-increasing cost. However, existing efforts mainly focus on informatization of hospitals or medical institutions within organizations, and few are directly oriented to individuals. The strong demand for various health services from customers calls for the creation of powerful individual-oriented personalized health care service systems. Web service composition (WSC) and related technologies can greatly help one build such systems. This paper aims to present a newly developed platform called a Public oriented Health care Information Service Platform (PHISP) and several novel WSC techniques that are used to build it. Among them include WSC techniques that can well support branch and parallel structures.

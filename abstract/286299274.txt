The procedure of picking services bound to abstract tasks is usually called service selection in Service Oriented Architecture. In recent years, most studies focus on improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of the composed service. These techniques, however, are facing a new challenge, brought by the big data era, namely, the time and money wasted in data transmission, called transmission cost, cannot be optimized locally like QoS. To address this challenge, in this paper, we study and formalize the problem of transmission cost aware service selection, named TcSS. Owing to the insufficient service transfer rates, we propose a framework on a relaxation problem by making use of the service network ontology structure. The entire framework comprises two stages, an off-line stage to arrange the service network information from logs and an online stage to satisfy the service selection requirement efficiently. The solution of the relaxation problem is an approximation of the original TcSS with the approximate ratio guarantees. Finally, extensive experiments on real data establish the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

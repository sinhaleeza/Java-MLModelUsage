Data Providing Services (DPSs) have the sole purpose of retrieving data from existing sources according to their input parameters while also providing a semantic description of the data they provide using a parametrized view over a domain ontology. A layered model of viewing DPSs is proposed consisting of the data acquisition, syntactic and semantic layers. It is shown that by defining all three layers, a DPS may be generated and managed exclusively by its declarative definition. This will increase the agility and efficiency with which DPSs may be deployed and managed. As a development model, a set of reusable messages are created, these messages are to be semantically annotated using a view over the domain ontology and are syntactically represented such that they may be exported to XML Schema. These messages are used within the DPS definition where their views over the domain ontology are parametrized and the data acquisition layer is defined to acquire data from the source.

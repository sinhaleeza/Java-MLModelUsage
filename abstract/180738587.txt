We describe a complete and largely automated method for the development of systems from Web services, which comprises the encapsulation of services, as well as their composition, verification and subsequent implementation in a model-driven manner. The paper follows the steps of the method: In a first phase, we import WSDL descriptions automatically as UML~2.x activities and provide them as building blocks, with some optional, manual adaptations. In a second phase, these building blocks can be used to compose an application that orchestrates Web services. The building blocks have behavioral contracts that enable automated, incremental verification based on compositional model checking. We demonstrate the approach by a subscription-based service to receive SMS messages.

Merging orchestrations is a crucial issue in the development process of service-based applications. However, merging orchestrations with overlaps is a manual and tedious process today. In this paper, we present a case-study on the Bronze-Standard, a medical imaging application built from Web-Service based orchestrations. We introduce the OMSM, an orchestration model supporting merging, that we designed to assist this process. Through a detailed analysis of the use-case, we show how our model helps the developer to obtain a proper composition of the application. There is still room for generalizing the approach to a broader set of orchestrations as discussed.

Performing functionality testing in service-oriented architectures is not a trivial task. The difficulty is especially the large number of components that may be present in a SOA such as brokers, providers, service registries, clients, monitoring tools, data storage tools, etc. Thus, in order to facilitate the process of conducting functional testing and capacity planning in service-oriented systems, we present PEESOS. This first version is a functional prototype that offers facilities to assist researchers and industry to test their new applications, allowing collaborations that can be done between the participants to achieve an appropriate objective when developing a new application. The first results show that it is possible to make a planning environment easier to operate and to readily obtain results for performance evaluation of a target architecture. Since this is a first version of the prototype, it has interface and scalability limitations as well as needing improvements in performance of the logs repository and also in a core engine. We hope that such limitations can be corrected in the near future, including gathering information from the scientific community to make the prototype a useful and accessible tool. PEESOS is on-line and available at http://peesos.wsarch.lasdpc.icmc.usp.br.

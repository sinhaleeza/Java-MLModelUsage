There is a common consensus on the role that social technologies could play in improving business process management. However several challenges continue to undermine this role. In this paper we discuss a specific challenge, which is the lack of formalization to describe cloud resources used by business processes. Building upon our previous work on social business processes we develop a framework that provides a semantic description of cloud resources, strategies to ensure their correct use based on this description, as well as a set of social relations connecting them. Thereby, this framework helps to guarantee a free-of-conflict resource allocation during business process execution. To illustrate our framework doability, an extension of Signavio process editor is developed using a real use case from an industrial partner.

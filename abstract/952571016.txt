For users' convenient access to Web services, this paper presents a method for generating XForms based user interfaces from WSDL files. The proposed method uses an XML schema in a WSDL file, and consists of three steps: processing a WSDL file, generating XForms codes, and embedding them into a host language document. Specifically, to generate XForms codes, rules for generating XForms codes, which support complex types and map simple types into appropriate input controls, are proposed. Experimental results with a large volume of WSDL files show that the proposed method generates XForms-based user interfaces from most of WSDL files successfully.

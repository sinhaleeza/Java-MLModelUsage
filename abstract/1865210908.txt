Cloud computing is a suitable platform to execute the deadline-constrained scientific workflows which are typical big data applications and often require many hours to finish. Moreover, the problem of energy consumption has become one of the major concerns in clouds. In this paper, we present a cost and energy aware scheduling (CEAS) algorithm for cloud scheduler to minimize the execution cost of workflow and reduce the energy consumption while meeting the deadline constraint. The CEAS algorithm consists of five sub-algorithms. First, we use the VM selection algorithm which applies the concept of cost utility to map tasks to their optimal virtual machine (VM) types by the sub-makespan constraint. Then, two tasks merging methods are employed to reduce execution cost and energy consumption of workflow. Further, In order to reuse the idle VM instances which have been leased, the VM reuse policy is also proposed. Finally, the scheme of slack time reclamation is utilized to save energy of leased VM instances. According to the time complexity analysis, we conclude that the time complexity of each sub-algorithm is polynomial. The CEAS algorithm is evaluated using Cloudsim and four real-world scientific workflow applications, which demonstrates that it outperforms the related well-known approaches.

Service providers (SP) business goals require an efficient management of their computational resources in order to perform provisioning, deployment, execution and adaptation which traditionally require human intervention. The semantically-enhanced resource allocator (SERA) is a framework designed to obtain an efficient autonomous service provider management while fulfilling customers' requests. While the efficient dynamic resource management is obtained by means of virtualization and agents, in this paper, we focus on how semantics can help on the task scheduling and resource allocation. In SERA, tasks and resources are semantically described following a resource ontology and resource assignments are inferred by means of a set of rules that define the scheduling policies taking into account the SP business goals.

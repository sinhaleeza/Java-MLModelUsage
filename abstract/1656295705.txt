The paper employs three types of agents namely resource brokering agents (RBAs), job agents (JAs), and resource monitoring agents (RMAs) for resource allocation in grid computing. RBA acts as a resource scheduler as well as a broker for the users to submit their jobs through JAs. JAs search for the resources. RMAs reside inside the nodes of the local cluster and inform the status of the resources to the local cluster server. The proposed model is evaluated in a simulated environment to test its operational effectiveness in various scenarios.

This paper proposes a hybrid scheduling scheme to combine the priority queueing and Packet General Processor Sharing (PGPS) algorithm for Multimedia Cloud Services in Software Defined Network (SDN). The network calculus theory is employed to develop modeling and analysis techniques for evaluating the QoS performance of the proposed scheduling scheme. Both analytical and numerical results obtained in this paper show that the proposed scheme can provide QoS guarantee for meeting diverse requirements of multimedia applications.

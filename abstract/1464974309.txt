Web services are considered reusable elements that can be exploited stand-alone or as part of wider, generic or domain-specific, applications. With a vast variety of Web Services being offered by service providers, annotation techniques that add tags to services automatically are frequently exploited with the aim of retrieving relevant services faster. Tagging of Web Services at finer levels of granularity can assist in drawing more detailed conclusions, making their use easier. In this paper, we go beyond global Web Service tagging by proposing a classification technique for the annotation of Web Service sections. The process focuses on port type, operation and message sections of the service description. Service information as offered through WSDL and the provider and user descriptions is considered. The initial evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in providing annotations at these different service levels.

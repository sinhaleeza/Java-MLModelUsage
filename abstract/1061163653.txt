Location-sensitive information monitoring services are a centerpiece of the technology for disseminating content-rich information from massive data streams to mobile users. The key challenges for such monitoring services are characterized by the combination of spatial and non-spatial attributes being monitored and the wide spectrum of update rates. A typical example of such services is "alert me when the gas price at a gas station within 5 miles of my current location drops to 4 per gallon". Such a service needs to monitor the gas price changes in conjunction with the highly dynamic nature of location information. Scalability of such location sensitive and content rich information monitoring services in the presence of different update rates and monitoring thresholds poses a big technical challenge. In this paper, we present SLIM, a scalable location sensitive information monitoring service framework with two unique features. First, we make intelligent use of the correlation between spatial and non-spatial attributes involved in the information monitoring service requests to devise a highly scalable distributed spatial trigger evaluation engine. Second, we introduce single and multi-dimensional safe value containment techniques to efficiently perform selective distributed processing of spatial triggers to reduce the amount of unnecessary trigger evaluations. Through extensive experiments, we show that SLIM offers high scalability for location-sensitive, content-rich information monitoring services in terms of the number of information sources being monitored, number of users and monitoring requests.

Business processes realized by services rely on the functionality of these services. Maintaining the interoperability when services evolve independently is therefore an important and challenging problem. If adaptation is to happen automatically, then determining and categorizing changes and their solutions is crucial. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (1) we provide an overview of previously defined mismatches and provide a common representation based on model management operators. (2) We present a categorization of changes with the categories non-effective, solvable and problematic and validate our categorization. (3) We provide solutions for changes that fall under the solvable category in terms of adaptation operators and describe the process of (self-) adaptation.

Service selection, where some of the services are accessed indirectly as constituents of composite services, is difficult for the following reasons: (1) the interpretation of service qualities is subjective; (2) evidence must be combined from multiple sources; (3) service profiles change dynamically; and (4) constituent services may be only partially observable behind composite services. We propose an approach where we map service qualities to a common probabilistic trust metric. Whereas current trust approaches estimate the trustworthiness of a composite service based on a fully observable and static setting, we propose a statistical approach built on expectation maximized over a finite mixture model. Our experiments show that our approach can dynamically punish or reward the constituents of composite services while making only partial observations.

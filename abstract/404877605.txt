SOA brought significant progress in information systems development, but the full exploitation of its advantages is sometimes hindered by specific problems. One of them is concerned with paradigm of Model Driven Development (MDD), where it is necessary to control correctness of the whole design within many models on different levels of abstraction. This is the place, where we would like to contribute. We propose a new approach to application of SOA design patterns in the development process. Patterns are transformed into a machine acceptable form using category theory and attributed graphs. This form is language independent, leads up to automated detection of pattern or antipattern in the description/model of SOA based system and in the future can facilitate also correctness checking.

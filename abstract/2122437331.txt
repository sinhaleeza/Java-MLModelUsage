This paper presents a meta-model based approach to services applications deployment on constrained execution environments (EEs) which contain heterogeneous services implementations. Indeed, the targeted EEs are conceived to be hidden in electrical equipments and so belong to the embedded/reactive domain and to its constraints. The language provided by our meta-model, is called DLSA (deployment language for services applications), which is a services applications language for deployment under the conditions mentioned above. The deployment manager for services applications (DMSA) using our language was implemented to realize and validate our work. Our approach is motivated by a real case from power distribution.

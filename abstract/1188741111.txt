WS are distributed software components that can be exposed and invoked over the Internet using standard protocols. They communicate with their clients and with other WS by sending XML based messages over the Internet. AI planning techniques can help solving the composition of WS problem. In fact, services can be modelled as actions and the business process as planning to connect the WS. The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the model of actions to handle the creation or elimination of objects as effects of actions. This contribution allows us to answer to new and more expressive requests, called implicit requests, in which goals may contain objects that have been generated by the plan.

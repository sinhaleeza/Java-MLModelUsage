In the practice of process-centric systems implementations, business process modeling is becoming more crucial. This paper introduces an approach to automatically generate test suites for the process paths to check the consistency, which is very important, between the business process model and the implementation of Enterprise System. The paper also presents a supporting tool to apply this approach in SAP implementation. A large-scale enterprise transformation program is discussed as a case study.

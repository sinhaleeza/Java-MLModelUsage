In this work we propose an approach for verifying privacy timed-related properties of web service protocol. While in [anal] the addressed problem in business protocols is focused on the analysis and management of functional requirements that support rich timing constraints, our approach extends the previous results to capture the timed behavior of privacy constraints. Hence, we provide a model called Timed Private Business Protocol TPBP. Next, we emphasize the timed properties related to privacy in TPBP. Finally, we present the different types of timed property verification to achieve upon the timed private business protocol.

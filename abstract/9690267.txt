This study introduces a sound-based mobile payment system as a wireless Web service. Using a mobile phone for payment for mobile commerce is essential for its success. The proposed system will use sound that is generated from the existing mobile phone and the sound can be recognized by the existing credit card reader of the shop with an installation of an ordinary microphone and simple software to process sound input. This system is a better system since it doesn't require customers to buy a new mobile phone and the cost for the microphone and the software is very low.

The grid technology is expected to have the ability of resolving the problem of large-scale information resources sharing in virtual organizations, which deliver a number of grid services to publish large-scale information to end-users. We propose an intelligent client to grid services, which manipulate information resources at semantic level and provides end-users with a universal and intuitive semantic view for various grid services. With a series of semantic plug-ins in semantic browser, end-users can gain richer interaction with grid services and resolve complex domain problems in a more intuitive and friendly environment.

Traditional, centralized orchestration of composite Web services often leads to inefficient routing of messages. To solve this problem, we present a novel scheme to execute composite Web services in a fully decentralized way. We introduce service invocation triggers, a lightweight infrastructure that routes messages directly from the producing service to the consuming one, enabling fully decentralized orchestration. An evaluation confirms that decentralized orchestration can significantly reduce the network traffic when compared with centralized orchestration

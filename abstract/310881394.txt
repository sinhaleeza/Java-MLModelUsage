Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in using Web services for data publishing and sharing among organizations. To improve the efficiency of software development and economize on human and material resources, service reuse is viewed as a powerful means which will not only reuse atomic services, but also reuse arbitrary granularities of Service Process Fragments (SPFs). However, effectively reusing arbitrary granularities of SPFs has not been solved yet. In this paper, we propose a novel method of SPF reuse, named SCKY, based on the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm. We first present an extended CKY to do SPF-query. Then we address how to do SPF-query by a probability CKY, i.e. return a SPF with maximum emergence probability. Finally, we explore the QoS Query of SPF. Through a set of experiments, the effectiveness and robustness of our approach are evaluated, where the dataset is constructed by the Web Service Challenge Testset Generator1 (CTG).

This paper proposes a hybrid concurrency control scheme for transactional composite services. The scheme uses the information gathered from the workflow specifications of the composite services to reduce the overhead in detecting cycles in the serialization graph. The scheme carries out runtime analysis of the SQL statements used by the composite services to determine whether the clients that execute composite services depend on each other more accurately. As a result, it reduces the response time to some users. The proposed scheme also tackles the repeated rollback problem facing many concurrency control schemes.

Information on web and in use of web services is increasing enormously even on hourly bases. On semantic web the information is represented in ontology. For system and services to share the information, a sort of mediation (i.e., mappings) is required. Mappings are established between the ontologies (information sources) of web services for resolving the terminological and conceptual incompatibilities. However, with the discovery of new knowledge in the field and accommodating the knowledge in domain ontologies makes the ontology to evolve from one consistent state to another. This consequently makes existing mappings between ontologies unreliable and staled due to the changes in resources. So there is a need for mapping evolution to eliminate discrepancies from the existing mappings. To re-establish the mappings between dynamic ontologies, existing systems restart the complete mapping process which is time consuming. The approach proposed in this paper provides the benefits of mapping reconciliation between the updated ontologies. It takes less time as compared to the existing systems. It only considers the changed resources and eliminates the staleness from the mappings. This approach uses the change history of ontology to drastically reduce the time required for reconciling mappings among ontologies. Experimental results with four different mapping systems using standard data sets are provided that validate our claims.

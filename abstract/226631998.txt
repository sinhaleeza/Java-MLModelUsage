Because of load fluctuating, the performance of service-based system(SBS) in the cloud environment may deviate from service level agreement(SLA). In the cloud environment, it is important to dynamically allocate resource for SBS according to the predicted system load, so as to satisfy global SLA constraint and minimize resource cost. By the analysis of complex business logic in SBS and the feature of dynamic resource allocation problem, this paper models the dynamic resource allocation problem as composite optimization problem and proposes the cost optimization oriented dynamic resource allocation model. Then this paper applies genetic algorithm to solve the dynamic resource allocation model so as to improve the resolving efficiency. Finally, the approach proposed in this paper is evaluated and compared with some related algorithms. It reveals very encouraging results in terms of the quality of resource allocation.

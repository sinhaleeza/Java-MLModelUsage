We proposed service processing agent which enables end-users to use context aware services easily. In ubiquitous network environments in the future, context-aware services are expected because the context-awareness is one of the most important factors in ubiquitous network. Therefore, the flexible service composition based on user context is required. Our proposed approach is that a service processing agent searches and selects suitable service components based on the user context and binds them dynamically. Users can send a request to the service processing agent in usual Web service messaging. Through the study, implementation and performance measurement, we showed the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed method.

The rapid proliferation of enormous sources of digital data and the development of cloud computing have led to greater dependence on data-intensive services. Each service may actually request or create a large amount of data sets. To compose these services will be more challenging. Issues of autonomy, scalability, adaptability, and robustness, become difficult to resolve. In order to automate the process of reaching an agreement in data-intensive service provision, the ant-inspired negotiation mechanism is considered in this paper. There are two-stage negotiation procedures in our model, which will provide effective and efficient service selection for service composers. We also present a multi-phase, multi-party negotiation protocol, where the ant colony system is applied for selecting the services. The experimental results show that our ant-inspired negotiation approach can facilitate the data-intensive service provision.

We propose a framework and polynomial algorithms for semantic-based automated Web service orchestration, fully compliant with semantic Web technologies. The approach exploits the recently proposed concept abduction inference service in description logics to solve concept covering problems. We present how the proposed approach deals with not exact solutions, computing an approximate orchestration with respect to an agent request modeled using a significant subset of OWL-DL.

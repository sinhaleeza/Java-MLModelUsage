Web Services provide a standards-based open platform for integrating distributed service components. The development of large distributed XML Web Services is greatly simplified with XML data binding tools that automate XML parsing and serialization by binding XML to native data structures. This paper presents a schema slicing method to remove unused schema components from schemas, thereby significantly reducing the XML data binding code size of WSDL-based Web Services. Our results show that schema slicing applied to large Web Services, such as ONVIF, results in the removal of 70% of the schema components on average. Our method also obtains significant schema size reductions for several popular WSDL-based Web Services, such as eBay Web Services (10% reduction), PayPal Web Services (18% reduction), Microsoft Exchange Web Services (4% reduction), Amazon S3 Web Services (22% reduction) and ESRI ArcGIS Web Services (42% to 59% reduction). We implemented schema slicing in the popular gSOAP toolkit.

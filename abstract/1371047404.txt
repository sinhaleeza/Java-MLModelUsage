This work presents an assessment model of service interoperability for service composition, which helps users to judge whether their composite services can be invoked properly. The model provides a clean and easy way to evaluate interoperability between autonomous services in open and large-scale distributed environments. This paper first summarizes and analyzes different levels of service interoperability, then proposes a multifactor decision model to assess interoperability, and finally discusses some patterns to use the model.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for verifying a conformance between choreography and the black box implementation of stateful Web service whose only external behaviors can be observed. Our framework uses an adapted version of Angluin's algorithm to infer a Mealy machine model that represents the observable behaviors of the implemented Web service. By transforming the Mealy machine to the modeling formalism LTS, the model checker LTSA can be used for checking a trace equivalence relation which is the conformance criterion in this work.

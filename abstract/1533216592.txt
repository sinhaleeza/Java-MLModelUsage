For realizing non-intrusive protection of open SCADA systems, a non-intrusive solution for distributed open SCADA systems is proposed. The solution consists of three functionality parts: Abstract Execution, Refine State, and Behavior Checking. The approach provides a runtime verification of the system by combining cyclic semantic reconstruction of VM and abstract execution of SCADA services. First, all Internet packets through virtual network bridges are extracted and symbolically linked to specific service model to get simulated traces. Then, cyclic semantic reconstruction is performed to acquire the current service runtime state. According to the service instance state of semantic reconstruction, the simulated traces are refined. When a trace is identified, behavior checking is adopted to verify whether the runtime state is compliant to the system specification that is defined based on milestone events for meeting SCADA real-time requirements.

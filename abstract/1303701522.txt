In order to meet the dynamic business environment, the alignment of business services and IT services has long been a challenge to both business and IT people. In this paper, a graph centric, two-phase analysis and design method for service system is proposed which is based on the recent evolutions in these fields like service oriented architecture (SOA). The method proposed in this paper views a service system comprising of business services and IT services as a layered complex system and uses matrices to represent the interactions between different layers. The method could help decision makers to analyze the impact of service changes during service design period. This could also facilitate the design of a more flexible IT service system reacting to business changes. The aim of this paper is to seek balance among different parts of a service system, and to provide a holistic view of the system for different role players. Results from this paper could give service designers some insights on how to design an enterprise service bus (ESB) in the SOA architecture of an enterprise

Today's business processes are often controlled and supported by information systems. These systems record real-time information about business processes during their executions. This enables the analysis at runtime of the process behavior. However, many modern systems produce “big data”, i.e., collections of data sets so large and complex that it becomes impossible to store and process all of them. Moreover, few processes are in steady-state but, due to changing circumstances, they evolve and systems need to adapt continuously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the discovery of LTL-based declarative process models from streaming event data in settings where it is impossible to store all events over an extended period of time or where processes evolve while being analyzed. The framework continuously updates a set of valid business constraints based on the events occurred in the event stream. In addition, our approach is able to provide meaningful information about the most significant concept drifts, i.e., changes occurring in a process during its execution. We report about experimental results obtained using synthetic logs and a real-life event log pertaining to the treatment of patients diagnosed with cancer in a large Dutch academic hospital.

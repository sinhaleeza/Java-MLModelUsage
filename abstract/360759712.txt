Decentralized execution settings are primordial for most processes where process participants are required to establish P2P interactions. This is particularly true for processes that subject the composition of services advertising different information flow policies. To provide a systematic approach to manage the information flow between composed services, we present a methodology that derives cooperating distributed processes of a centralized specification with respect to their information flow policies. Our contribution shows how service compositions, that cannot be realized with centralized orchestrations or inconsistent choreographies, can be realized with equivalent decentralized executions in an inexpensive and in a reasonable manner.

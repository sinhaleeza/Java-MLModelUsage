QoS-aware service composition is a bi-objectivetask for the generation of a business process: to fulfill functional goals and to optimize the QoS criteria. Planning algorithms are frequently used for the generation of a business process to achieve functional goals. In this paper, we use a planning algorithm, GraphPlan, and a graph search algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, to achieve both functional goals and QoS optimization at the same time. Firstly, we analyze graph reachability in the planning graph built by Graphplan algorithm.Taking advantage of graph reachability, we propose an approach of using Graphplan technique combined with Dijkstra's algorithm to solve QoS-aware service composition problem. The experiments show our approach is able to findthe optimal solution for different QoS criteria. Moreover, our approach reduces the possibilities of combinatorial explosion to a large degree when exploring the graph for the optimal path.

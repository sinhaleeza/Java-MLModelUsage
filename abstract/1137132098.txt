In service oriented computing different techniques for monitoring service level agreements (SLAs) are available. Many of these monitoring approaches focus on bilateral agreements between partners. However, when monitoring composite services it is not only important to figure out whether SLAs are violated, but we also need to analyze why these violations have occurred. When offering a composite service a company depends on its content providers to meet the service level they agreed upon. Due to these dependencies a company should not only monitor the SLA of the composite service, but also the SLAs of the services it depends on. By analyzing and monitoring the composite service in this way, causes for SLA violations can be easier found. In this paper we demonstrate how to analyze SLAs during development phase and how to monitor these dependencies using event logs during runtime. We call our approach MoDe4SLA (monitoring dependencies for SLAs).

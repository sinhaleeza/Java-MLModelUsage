The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of web services (e.g. e-commerce, e- health) leading to the need to protect the privacy of web service users. However, before privacy can be protected, it is necessary to understand the risks to privacy that come with the service. Indeed, such understanding is key to protecting privacy throughout the service lifecycle. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any existing method for privacy risk analysis specifically designed for web services. This paper presents a straightforward method for web services privacy risk analysis that uses visual techniques to improve effectiveness and illustrates the method with an example.

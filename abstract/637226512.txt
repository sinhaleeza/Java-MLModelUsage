Discovering and correcting interaction mismatches in inter-organizational business processes are important for service choreography. Automatic discovery mismatches and providing correcting plans will alleviate burdens on business modelers, however, three major challenges are: 1. by what cost model to evaluate multiple correcting plans; 2. how to avoid generating new mismatches when correcting processses;3. how to effectively reduce the search space size. In this paper, we first extend our previous approach to discover interaction mismatches, and present a cost model for evaluating correcting plans; secondly, we propose an independent modifying region-based method to obtain multiple correcting plans which can avoid generating new mismatches, and reduce the search space for finding out correcting plans. A running example is given to illustrate the validity.

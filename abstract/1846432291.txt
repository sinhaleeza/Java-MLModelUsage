Product development in mechanical industry can be defined as an engineering process based on the collaboration between different experts using various engineering services. The e-Engineering framework aims to integrate engineering services and mediate between them for the processing of the engineering process. The collaboration within the framework is very similar to a business process, in terms of web service composition. However, the existing web service composition system shows some limitations when dealing with engineering services. This paper presents a QoS-based web service orchestration system for the e-Engineering framework by analyzing the characteristics of engineering services which usually perform numerical analysis. The characteristics of the services are expressed in the form of constraint and selection specification.

In ambient intelligence (AmI) environments, some services provided by AmI devices are often not visible to users and to other devices. The existing approaches deal with services' composition and discovery as two independent parts. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on logical reasoning agent system. This system is supported by a communication protocol where agents discover automatically services provided in their environment and construct dynamically composite services. The service composition is constructed from an exchange of idiomatic expressions among agents and users, while the discovery process takes the form of an information request via the communication protocol. The advantage of this approach is that agents are able to acquire knowledge from each other and when interacting with users. This capability will facilitate the satisfaction of user's requirements in an intelligent way. This study shows that agents are able to satisfy new services previously unknown to the system.

Web service orchestration engines need to be more open to enable the addition of new features into service-based applications. In this paper, we illustrate how, in a BPEL engine with aspect-weaving capabilities, a process-driven application based on the Google Web service can be dynamically adapted with new features and hot-fixed to meet unforeseen post-deployment requirements. Business processes (the application skeletons) can be enriched with additional features such as debugging, execution monitoring, or an application-specific GUI. Dynamic aspects are also used on the processes themselves to tackle the problem of hot-fixes to long running processes. In this manner, composing a Web service 'on-the-fly' means weaving its choreography interface into the business process.

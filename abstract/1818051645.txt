During the design procedure of BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) processes, there may be control dependency deadlocks among the activities in BPEL. We design a novel Agree/Refuse Matrix (ARM) to real-timely detect control dependency deadlocks. Online detection approach can be integrated into Active BPEL Designer to extend their functions and improve the accuracy of BPEL processes. Most importantly, this method's real-time property can help avoiding detecting the whole process from scratch caused by process's partial modifications.

Modern applications are increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous and their lifecycle is more and more governed by autonomic managers that are also getting more and more complex. The purpose of this paper is to present a service-oriented framework that facilitates the development and management of dynamically extensible autonomic managers. More precisely, we propose an architecture based on the opportunistic collaboration of very specialized and coherent modules called administration tasks. The current framework prototype has been implemented as a specialized Service-Oriented Component Model. It allows the dynamic integration of autonomic tasks and their management based on contextual evolutions.

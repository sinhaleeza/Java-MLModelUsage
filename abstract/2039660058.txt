When Service Oriented applications and services are modeled, the term Quality of Service (QoS) is used to refer to the collection of constraints and quality requirements for a service. It is important that QoS attributes are specified in early stages of the development process, and modeled in a way that can be recognized and understood by all stakeholders. Regarding Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) modeling, QoS usually includes security, performance and availability. There are many options to realize business processes with services, such as collaborations with partners, internal services, third parties services (SaaS) among others. In previous works we have proposed the automatic generation of services specified in the Service Architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) from business processes, and the associated code. As SoaML allows to model functional requirements only, we have extended our proposal to also take into account QoS modeling and generation from SoaML service models, enriching the specification of services with quality characteristics.

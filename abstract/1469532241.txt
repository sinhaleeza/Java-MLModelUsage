Establishing promising and efficient key distribution is the cornerstone of security when applying cryptographic methods to guard the privacy of smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, when using conventional key distribution methods in real-time mobile services, it is usually deficient to build multiple channels with strong security simultaneously on a single data server. Therefore, we focus our research on collecting or monitoring real-time and remote data, which is commonly observed in the health care field of the IoT. In this research, there are difficulties to apply the conventional key distribution approaches during interactions when considering both security and efficiency. Moreover, when preserving personal privacy, anonymity is also important in key distribution processes. We design a system of real-time mobile services and the related security requirements in this paper, and apply a novel and interesting Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (IBKEM) to instantiate our system and achieve anonymous key distribution with only one-pass communication for mobile clients in batch. Our instantiated system demonstrates both strong security and practice.

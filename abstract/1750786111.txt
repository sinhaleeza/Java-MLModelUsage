Small to medium businesses (SMBs) are an integral part of the U.S. economy, accounting for about half of private-sector output and employing more than half of private-sector workers. Managing limited resources as well as providing additional services that meet the range of customer expectations and improve the overall customer experience is a non-trivial activity for SMBs, who like any business, must focus on the seemingly conflicting goals of minimizing cost while maximizing customer value and profit. Queue management has been a problem for many years as an organization's ability (or inability) to adequately address queue management often has a direct correlation to the quality a customer associates with an overall service experience. This study describes Queue Admin, a database driven, online application designed to support SMBs in the management of various queues uncovering the impact that Queue Admin's design and delivery has on the quality of customers' overall service experience.

Most human centric business activities, like the handling of an insurance claim or the design of an IT solution, do not follow a formal process model word-by-word. While there are often underlying processes in place, the real business operation typically encompasses a wider scope of actions. It includes unstructured segments of human activities, additional documents and interactions, the integration of remote systems and services, and the reactions to exceptional situations. With the case management approach, the knowledge worker in the center takes control and acts as an orchestrator of available services rather than being a part of an assembly line. This paper presents how data-centric web services can be used to build a service-oriented case management application, and how advanced analytics can leverage historical information to improve the effectiveness of business processes execution.

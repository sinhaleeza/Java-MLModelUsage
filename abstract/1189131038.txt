Service computing technologies have been widely applied to many application domains to facilitate rapid system integration for desired goals. However, existing service models need to be enhanced for cyber-physical systems (CPS) and internet-of-things (IoT). In this paper, we develop an ontology model for the specification of services in CPS/IoT. First, we discuss the major differences in modeling software services and services in CPS/IoT. Then, we propose a novel PT-SOA (PT stands for physical things) model, which is mainly extended from OWL-S, to enhance existing service models for CPS/IoT systems. Finally, we show a case study system to illustrate how our model can facilitate proper service selection and composition.

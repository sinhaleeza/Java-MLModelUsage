With the rapid development of service-oriented computing (SOC)/service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing and web services, cloud-based design and manufacture (CBDM) is emerging as state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to enable collaborative product development (CPD). CBDM-enabled CPD can provide cost-effective, flexible and scalable solutions to collaborative partners by sharing the resources in the applications of design and manufacturing. Feature-based data exchange (FBDE) has been one of the key issues in history of CPD and should be adapted in lasted CBDM-enabled CPD. Firstly this paper presents a service-oriented architecture for data exchange in CBDM. Within this architecture, FBDE was registered as service and FBDE users in the CBDM environment can acquire a set of FBDE services to replace the traditional FBDE functions among heterogeneous CAD systems. Secondly, in orderto put the philosophy of FBDE-as-a-Service into practice for CBDM, this paper proposes a peerto peer (P2P) approach for service-oriented FBDE, which revolutionizes the traditional centralized and neutral-file based approach. Thirdly, technique issues of FBDE-as-a-Service in P2P architecture are discussed in details, including constituting of the P2P FBDE service, procedure of service-oriented P2P FBDE, pre-P2P FBDE service, topological entity matching between pre/post-P2P service and post-P2P FBDE service. Finally, a case study of data exchange is tested to demonstrate the proposed idea of service-oriented FBDE for CBDM.

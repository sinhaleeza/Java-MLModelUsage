With the rapid development of Internet technology, a new architecture named Content-Centric Networking (CCN) has emerged recently. With powerful abilities of data caching and multicast, it has been increasingly popular especially for multimedia applications. However, service markup, in-network caching and routing are not inherently addressed in CCN. In this paper, we make an attempt at filling this gap by designing an ontology-based semantic service markup for CCN. Two components which are Service Identifier (SID) and Service Behavior Description (SBD) are presented in order to decouple the service entity with its original physical location, making it possible for service discovery and caching in CCN environments. Detailed designs are introduced, and a case study of an online multimedia conference system is presented to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

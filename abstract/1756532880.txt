The potential benefits of Web services composition heavily rely on semantic interoperability, i.e., the ability to exchange data meaningfully amongst Web services. Context heterogeneity, which refers to different implicit assumptions about interpreting the exchanged data, hampers the automatic composition of Web services. However, existing initiatives of semantic Web services (SWSs) often ignore context heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce an approach to address this issue. The contexts of the involved Web services are defined in a lightweight ontology and their WSDL descriptions are annotated by an extension of a W3C standard, i.e., semantic annotation for WSDL and XML schema (SAWSDL). The composition of Web services is described using BPEL specification. Given a BPEL file that ignores context heterogeneity, the approach automatically detects all context differences among the involved services, and reconciles them by producing a mediated BPEL file that incorporates necessary conversions using Xpath functions and/or Web services.

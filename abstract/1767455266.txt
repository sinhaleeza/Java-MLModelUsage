With the increased number of richness service resources, and maturity of (Service Oriented Architecture) SOA-based solutions, it is critical to develop an innovative software engineering methodology for user-centric and on-demand service oriented computing. This paper proposes the RGPS (Role-Goal-Process-Service) requirements meta-modeling framework for service requirements elicitation, analysis, and modeling. Meanwhile, the standardization on service interoperability is a key driver to realize on-demand services based on various service resources. We have developed the ISO standards series: MFI (meta-model framework for interoperability) and MFI (Ontology-RGPS). We combine these two meta-model frameworks, which provide a foundation to bridge the gap from SOA to SSOA (Semantically-aware SOA), and further to On-Demand SOA.

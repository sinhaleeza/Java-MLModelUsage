Web APIs provide interfaces for interaction among systems based on the existing infrastructure for hosting Web sites and applications. The REST architectural style is the most employed approach for building Web APIs. However, the flexibility provided by REST may result in implementations with low quality design, limited reuse and poor documentation. This paper describes a maturity model for classifying Web APIs, aimed at promoting the adherence to REST architectural principles and the adoption of semantic Web technology in order to improve the design, reuse and documentation of Web APIs.

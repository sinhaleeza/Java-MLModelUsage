As many software systems have been turned as Web services, the evolutionary changes of Web services are becoming an important issue. To understand the way in which the change affects the services, we must ascertain parts of the system that will be effected by the change and examine them for additional impacts. In this paper, we propose an impact analysis model based on service dependency. In particular, the service dependency graph model, service dependency and the relation matrix are examined. Based on the shift and calculation of the matrix, the dependency and impact of the service evolution can be analyzed and its quantity can be ascertained. Furthermore, we also represent an approach for service change annotation and for service evolution process. Overall, these works provide a foundation for the automatic management, control, and evaluation of service evolution.

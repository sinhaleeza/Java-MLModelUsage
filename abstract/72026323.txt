This paper presents a service-oriented digital government infrastructure focused on efficiently providing customized services to senior citizens. We designed and developed a Web Service Management System (WSMS), called WebSenior, which provides a service-centric framework to deliver government services to senior citizens. The proposed WSMS manages the entire life cycle of third-party web services. These act as proxies for real government services. Due to the specific requirements of our digital government application, we focus on the following key components of WebSenior: service composition, service optimization, and service privacy preservation. These components form the nucleus that achieves seamless cooperation among government agencies to provide prompt and customized services to senior citizens.

An unprecedented volume of data is being generated in healthcare and life sciences, ranging across medical records, claims, lab data, genomics data, medical images, emerging exogenous data, and knowledge. Much of this data is moving to the cloud. In this paper, we describe examples of how the data from systems of record, exogenous data sources and knowledge sources can be combined at cloud scale and speed to create industry-transforming insights to improve health outcomes. We then describe a cloud architecture and building blocks that enable these solutions, and the compliance aspects that are critical to healthcare solutions. Finally, we outline a realization of this architecture and outline further research topics in this domain.

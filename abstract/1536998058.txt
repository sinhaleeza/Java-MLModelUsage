In modern utility computing infrastructures, like grids and clouds, one of the significant actions of a service provider is to predict the resources needed by the services included in its platform in an automated fashion for service provisioning optimization. Furthermore, a variety of software toolkits exist that implement an extended set of algorithms applicable to workload forecasting. However, their automated use as services in the distributed computing paradigm includes a number of design and implementation challenges. In this paper, a decoupled framework is presented, for taking advantage of software like GNU Octave in the process of creating and using prediction models during the service life cycle of a SOI. A performance analysis of the framework is also conducted. In this context, a methodology for creating parametric or gearbox services with multiple modes of operations based on the execution conditions is portrayed and is applied to transform the aforementioned service framework to optimize service performance. A new estimation algorithm is introduced, that creates performance rules of applications as black boxes, through the creation and usage of genetically optimized artificial neural networks. Through this combination, the critical parameters of the networks are decided through an evolutionary iterative process.

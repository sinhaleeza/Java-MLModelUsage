This paper presents the initial findings from a series of case studies involving the enterprise transformation to service oriented architecture. Ten large enterprises were studied to determine how they were able to convert their legacy IT architecture. Particular interest was paid to business models, governance, enterprise architecture, change management, risk management, and technology. These cases were used to form a predictive model of success factors in transformation.

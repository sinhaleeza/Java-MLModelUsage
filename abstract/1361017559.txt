Optimizing the Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels of a service workflow is essential for the user satisfaction in Service-oriented Computing. For that purpose, QoS computation models are applied to reflect the actual QoS experienced by the user during service execution. Current QoS models ignore the possible dependencies of QoS attributes, such as the dependency on the time of the execution or on the input data supplied to the service. Apart from that, composition approaches consider only single workflows during service selection, narrowing the number of possible compositions. Thus, we introduce a novel QoS model that covers QoS dependencies and discuss how this model can be used to consider multiple workflows at the same time. Moreover, we adopt a multi-objective optimization approach to offer solutions varying in QoS such as finishing time and price, allowing the user to make fine-grained decisions.

Progress in the field of Web services has resulted in deployment of a significant number of Web services. Furthermore, it is expected that the number of available Web services will constantly grow in the following years. Due to the high number of available Web services, it is a hard task for developers and business analysts to choose which Web services are most suitable for integration. However, despite the increased academic and commercial interest to Web services, there is currently no survey available analysing most relevant Web services. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available study analysing the structure and potential synergy between commercial and governmental Web services. In this paper we target these shortcomings by providing a case study of automated Web service composition for semantically annotated commercial and governmental Web services. We propose a method for identifying most applicable Web services and demonstrate it on a case study. We also analyse interaction and potential synergy between commercial and governmental Web services.

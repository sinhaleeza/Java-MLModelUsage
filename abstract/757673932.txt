Web services have had a tremendous impact on the Web for supporting a distributed service-based economy on a global scale. However, despite the outstanding progress, their uptake on a Web scale has been significantly less than initially anticipated. The isolation of services and the lack of social relationships among related services have been identified as reasons for the poor uptake. In this paper, we propose connecting the isolated service islands into a global social service network to enhance the services' sociability on a global scale. First, we propose linked social service-specific principles based on linked data principles for publishing services on the open Web as linked social services. Then, we suggest a new framework for constructing the global social service network following linked social service-specific principles based on complex network theories. Next, an approach is proposed to enable the exploitation of the global social service network, providing Linked Social Services as a Service. Finally, experimental results show that our approach can solve the quality of service discovery problem, improving both the service discovering time and the success rate by exploring service-to-service based on the global social service network.

We propose a system, called EVolution of Long-term Composed Services (Ev-LCS), to address the change management issues in long-term composed services (LCSs). An LCS is a dynamic collaboration between autonomous web services that collectively provide a value-added service. It has a long-term commitment to its users. We first present a formal model, which provides the grounding semantics to support the automation of change management. We present a set of change operators that allow to specify a change in a precise and formal manner. We then propose a change enactment strategy that actually implements the changes. We develop a prototype system for the proposed Ev-LCS to demonstrate its effectiveness. We also conduct an experimental study to assess the performance of the change management approach.

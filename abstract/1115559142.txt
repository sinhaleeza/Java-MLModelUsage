The service-oriented architecture paradigm prescribes the development of systems through the composition of services, i.e., network-accessible components, specified by (and invoked through) their WSDL interface descriptions. Systems thus developed need to be aware of changes in, and evolve with, their constituent services. Therefore, accurate recognition of changes in the WSDL specification of a service is an essential functionality in the context of the software lifecycle of service-oriented systems. In this work, we present the results of an empirical study on WSDL evolution analysis. In the first part, we empirically study whether VTracker, our algorithm for XML differencing, can precisely recognize changes in WSDL documents by applying it to the task of comparing 18 versions of the Amazon EC2 web service. Second, we analyze the changes that occurred between the subsequent versions of various web-services and discuss their potential effects on the maintainability of service systems relying on them.

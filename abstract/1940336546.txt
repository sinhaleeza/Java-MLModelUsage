With the prevalence of SOA, an increasing number of Web services are created and composed to construct complex business processes. Selecting an appropriate service from a lot of independently developed services which have the same functionality but different QoS properties is essential for the effect of the composite service according to users' preference. Moreover, the efficiency and effect of the service selection algorithm also play an important role. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, named QSSAC, for service selection problem. This algorithm is based on the service clustering which can cluster a lot of atomic services of each task into a few classes according to their QoS properties. With the help of service clustering, our algorithm is able to reduce the execution time and guarantee the near-optimal result as well. Finally, three strategies are provided for re-selecting atomic services in dynamic environment. In experiment, we study the performance of QSSAC algorithm, and its feasibility has been demonstrated by simulation.

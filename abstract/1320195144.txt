Different Web service standards, WS*, factorize Web service management tasks into different aspects, such as input/output, workflow, or security. WS* descriptions are exchangeable and developers may use different implementations for the same Web service description. Researchers investigating semantic Web services have clearly articulated these shortcomings of WS* standardizations and has been presenting interesting proposals to counter some of them. The kind of objectives that are to be approached are constrained by a costs trade-off between investing efforts for managing Web services and investing efforts for semantic modelling of Web Services. The objective of full automation by semantic modelling needs very fine-grained, detailed modelling of all aspects of Web services - essentially everything that an intelligent human agent must know. Thus, modelling costs skyrocket at the end of fine-grained modelling.

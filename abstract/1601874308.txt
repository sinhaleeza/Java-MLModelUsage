Automatically constructing a composite service from a set of basic services is not desirable in practice because the composition assumption often over-simplifies the realistic constraints and states. We try to propose a stepwise methodology to step-by-step construct a composite service, where the event-driven principle and process declaration principle are used to realize process flexibility, and user knowledge aggregation way is adopted to clarify users' demands and intents. For modeling services with flexibility, service decoupling feature based on events is utilized to decouple different parts of a business process, and to independently define process fragments. Process coordination logic among different process fragments is extracted as independent building blocks such that its enactment can be adapted at run-time. Thus, we get a method to model, deploy and run declarative business processes based on events. At run-time, we propose a service construction assistant to learn the complex relation between user clicks and service quality.

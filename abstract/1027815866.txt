Attributes credibility, trustiness and accuracy are often considered, but not incorporated in decision making algorithms. In this paper a credibility-based risk/business context model is proposed, to profile communication service requests using sources' credibility, as well as observed intensity and customizable policy-based prioritization. The paper proves that this Credibility-based approach can cope with the complexity and uncertainty of context models, which Bayes probabilities cannot, and with degrees of discordance and uncertainty, which DST cannot. The paper provides reviews of concepts and techniques to determine credibility from its components and aggregate corroborated credibility within observations and ultimately key factors of the model. The paper tests and proves the effectiveness of the modelled credibility, intensity and policy, and shows that incorporating Credibility is a better way to make informed decisions.

In a web service composition, an electronic contract (e-contract) regulates how the services participating in the composition should behave, including the restrictions that these services must fulfill, such as real-time constraints. In this work we present a visual model that allows us to specify e-contracts in a user friendly way, including conditional behavior and realtime constraints. A case study is presented to illustrate how this visual model defines e-contracts and a preliminary evaluation of the model is also done.

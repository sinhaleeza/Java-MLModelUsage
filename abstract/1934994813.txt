As more and more web services are available over the Internet, people have many choices to use one or some of them to fulfill their tasks. When the task is adequtely complicated, it is necessary to compose the related web services to complete it effectively and efficiently. Many algorithms have already been proposed to solve the web service composition problem by trying to find the candidate solutions with the best quality of service(QoS) while satisfying the functional goal. However, we may always find that the final solutions contain redundant services that is unnecessary and may cause extra executing costs. Hence, it is significant to remove the redundant services in the service composition process. In this paper, we address the above issues and propose a novel web service composition algorithm by integrating both QoS optimization and redundancy removal. Experimental results on the benchmark WSC'09 datasets have proven that our algorithm keeps less redundant services remained in the solution while keeping very good QoS performance.

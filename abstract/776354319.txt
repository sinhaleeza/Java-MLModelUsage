Web Services constitute a set of technologies that many believe will change the Web communication landscape within the next few years. They offer standardized and easy communications for distributed systems over the Internet. However their dynamic and distributed nature requires a well-managed system, and pending security issues prevent their widespread adoption. Meanwhile there is a big rage toward the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to secure communications in a cost-effective environment like the Internet. In this paper we explain how to merge these two technologies in a new powerful hybrid model that: (1) enables an easy management of Web services, (2) provides Web services security thanks to the use of dynamic and programmable VPNs, and (3) remains simple and fully integrated.

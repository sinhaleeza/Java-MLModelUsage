We propose a framework to discover proximate IoT service relationships based on spatio-temporal features. We introduce a spatio-temporal proximity model in terms of spatial-proximity and temporal-proximity to discard insignificant IoT service relationships. The proximity model focuses on quantifying the correlation strength among IoT services from time and location aspects. A new algorithm is proposed to discover proximate spatio-temporal IoT service relationships. We also present preliminary experimental results.

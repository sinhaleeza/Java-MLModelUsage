Current data sharing and integration among various organizations require a central and trusted authority to first collect data from all data sources and then integrate the collected data. This process tends to complicate the update of data and to compromise data sources' privacy. In this paper, a repository for integrating data from various data sharing services without central authorities is presented. The major differences between our repository and existing central authorities are: 1) Our repository collects data from data sharing services based on users' integration requirements rather than all the data from the data sharing services as existing central authorities. 2) While existing central authorities have full control of the collected data, the capability of our repository is restricted to computing the integration results required by users and cannot get other information about the data or use it for other purposes. 3) The data collected by our repository cannot be used to generate other results except that of the specified data integration request, and hence the compromise of our repository can only reveal the results of the specified data integration request, while the compromise of central authorities will reveal all data.

Web service clustering is one of a very efficient approach to discover Web services efficiently. Current clustering approaches use traditional clustering algorithms such as agglomerative as the clustering algorithm. The algorithms have not provided visualization of service clusters that gives inspiration for a specific domain from visual feedback and failed to achieve higher noise isolation. Furthermore iterative steps of algorithms consider about the similarity of limited number of services such as similarity of cluster centers. This leads to reduce the cluster performance. In this paper we apply a spatial clustering technique called the Associated Keyword Space(ASKS) which is effective for noisy data and projected clustering result from a three-dimensional (3D) sphere to a two dimensional(2D) spherical surface for 2D visualization. One main issue, which affects to the performance of ASKS algorithm is creating the affinity matrix. We use semantic similarity values between services as the affinity values. Most of the current clustering approaches use similarity distance measurement such as keyword, ontology and information-retrieval-based methods. These approaches have problem of short of high quality ontology and loss of semantic information. In this paper, we calculate the service similarity by using hybrid term similarity method which uses ontology learning and information retrieval. Experimental results show our clustering approach is able to plot similar services into same area and aid to search Web services by visualization of the service data on a spherical surface.

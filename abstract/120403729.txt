The concept of complex event processing (CEP) and complex-event-aware service have been extensively studied to retrieve relevant information from massive amount of realtime streaming events. In mobile environment, the Mobilityaware CEP (MCEP) system was proposed to address the issue of synchronization problem between different query ranges and MCEP operators. We noticed that MCEP systems lack the ability to process event in parallel and scale out when system load is high. In this paper, we proposed a parallel architecture for MCEP. The architecture can handle the synchronization problem and guarantee the correctness of event processing result. We also proposed a scaling strategy that can automatically scale out operators while ensures semantic transparency. An empirical evaluation based on up to 10 ViMs demonstrated that our approach is able to achieve higher throughput while keeping the MCEP synchronization mechanism valid.

With the proliferation of Web services, service engineers demand good automatic service composition algorithms that not only synthesize the correct work plans from thousands of services but also satisfy the quality requirements of the users. Our observation is that conventional approaches suffer from serious limitations in scalability and accuracy when addressing both requirements simultaneously. We have designed and implemented a tool QSynth to use QoS objectives of service requests as the search directives. This approach effectively prunes the search space and significantly improves the accuracy of the search results. Evaluations show that, compared to the state of the art, QSynth achieves superior scalability and accuracy with respect to a large variety of composition scenarios. Our design of QSynth won the performance championship of Web Services Challenge 2009.

Web services are becoming the prominent paradigm for distributing, computing, and electronic business, while there is an increasing surge to provide online business- to-business collaborations. The Web services choreography description language (WS-CDL) is a Web service specification developed by W3C, in order to provide peer-to-peer collaborations for participants from different parties. Despite the great research interests it has received during recent years, no practical or even prototype execution engine has been built for WS-CDL, which is, however, essential to test and evaluate the properties of WS-CDL when doing research on it, and promote its application fields in business. This paper implements an execution engine of WS-CDL, which has never been built before, and experiments on the functionalities and performance of the engine. We also address the extensions toward WS-CDL, namely WS- CDL+, which are built into our execution engine. Finally, the whole paper is concluded, addressing the application perspectives of WS-CDL/WS-CDL+.

The increasing complexity and dynamics in IT infrastructure and the emerging Cloud services present challenges to timely incident/problem diagnosis and resolution. In this paper we present a problem determination platform with multi-dimensional knowledge integration (e.g. configuration data, system vital data, log data, related tickets) and enablement for efficient incident and problem management of the enterprise. Three features of the platform are discussed: automated ticket classification, the automated association of resource with tickets based on integration with configuration database, and the collection of the system vitals relevant to the ticket through integration with monitoring systems. In response to the emerging Cloud services and their highly dynamic service operation context, we identify the need for a proactive service management approach which incorporates configurations and deployment of incident management tools, policies, and templates throughout the service life cycle in order to enable effective and efficient incident management in service operation.

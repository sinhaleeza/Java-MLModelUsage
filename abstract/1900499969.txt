It is common that multiple Web services coordinate to achieve a common goal. If two Web services happen to reside on the same runtime system, it is inefficient to communicate via Web services interface. This research proposes our short circuit switch (SCS), which is an intelligent Web services discovery and invocation engine that can be attached to deployed Web services. Our preliminary empirical experience shows that our short circuit switch engine exhibits high performance.

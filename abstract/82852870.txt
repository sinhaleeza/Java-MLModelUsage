We present a new approach for adapting Web processes to input data volatility while respecting possible coordination constraints between the process participants. We focus on modeling the decision making process of service managers that are responsible for accomplishing the activities of an abstractly defined process. Compared to previous approaches that either employ a process manager overseeing all service managers or have a coordination mechanism which must be perfectly observed by all service managers, our approach does not need any central component but endows each service manager with the ability to communicate with other service managers. We define a regret-based coordination mechanism in order to motivate managers to respond to the communication. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than the previous decentralized approach while addressing the scalability problem suffered by the globally optimal centralized approach.

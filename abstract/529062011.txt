Service composition environments enable people to create, manage, share services, and compose atomic services for their own requirements. Since users and service entity hosts are always distributed in locations in such environments, service responses might be very slow if users invoke services that are physically far from them, which is even slower for invoking composite services. However, those problems cannot be solved using traditional caching technologies in the areas of contents delivery network because service providers in service composition environments always have their own policies about service license issues, and do not allow their service entities to be copied on all service entity hosts. In this paper, we propose the approach of dynamically switching availability of services among service entity hosts based on the invocation request from users, and design several dynamic invocation control mechanisms to improve the response performance of services considering the service license constraints by service providers. Our proposed mechanisms are evaluated by simulation in service composition environments.

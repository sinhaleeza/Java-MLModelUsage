The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the promise of integrating the digital world of the Internet with the physical world in which we live. But realizing this promise necessitates a systematic approach to integrating the sensors, actuators, and information on which they operate into the Internet we know today. This paper reports the design and development of an open community-oriented platform aiming to support federated sensor data as a service, featuring interoperability and reusability of heterogeneous sensor data and data services. The concepts of virtual sensors and virtual devices are identified as central autonomic units to model scalable and context-aware configurable/reconfigurable sensor data and services. The decoupling of the storage and management of sensor data and platform-oriented metadata enables the handling of both discrete and streaming sensor data. A cloud computing-empowered prototyping system has been established as a proof of concept to host smart community-oriented sensor data and services.

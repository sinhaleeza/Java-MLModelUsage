The growing number of RESTful web services available on the web raises a challenging search problem as to how the desired web services should be located. Traditional keyword searching is inaccurate, and its limitations have been noted for several years. We propose a combination method of WADL and a learning ontology mechanism to enable RESTful semantic web services. These syntactic and semantic descriptions allow search engines to support a similarity search for RESTful web services. We describe an experimental study on a collection of 168 RESTful web services. The experimental results show that our method has higher performance in terms both of the rate of recall and precision compared to existing methods.

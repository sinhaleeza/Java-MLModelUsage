In this work we construct partial order plans from a pool of atomic services described in OWL-S. We make extensions to Partial Order Planning to allow multiple conditional effects in action definitions. The purpose is to handle the uncertain behavior of Web services with incomplete initial information. We post-process the partial order plan to auto-generate a workflow model. We developed a method to identify a subset of workflow patterns from the solution plan to create a workflow diagram.

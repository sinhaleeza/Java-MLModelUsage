Business process dynamics in services computing has become more and more important to satisfy today's variable enterprise requirements. Existing business process systems lack support for business process flexibility in practice, it has become increasingly difficult to cope with variable enterprise needs. To solve this problem, a dynamic business process model is introduced in this paper, and a dynamic business process generation algorithm is proposed. The verification of the generated business process is based on the Kripke structure to verify the proposed correctness properties specified in Computational Tree Logic (CTL). We implement a dynamic expansion module for dynamic business process engine based on jBPM5, in that way, a black box in the business process definition can be generated dynamically according to the Drools rules. We demonstrate the proposed approach in a real auditing business process system project. Our approach is generic and can reduce the maintenance costs and the risks during the project.

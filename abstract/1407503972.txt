Nowadays, we can conduct many businesses on the Internet, called e-business, like on the physical world. A general tool for communication on the Internet is a Webpage. The question is how one can get evidence to state the event when has disputes on the Internet. Available tools such as cybernotary will generate evidence when one requests. In reality, no one realize to do so, until the dispute occurs. So, a few people keep the evidence while the business occurs. This paper proposes the automatic e-evidence generation system that collects information passed through the Internet proactively. E-evidence is generated at a specific time that allows one who needs it for a later use to solve dispute. A trusted third party is an important mechanism to intercept Web pages between a Web server and browser. However, generating evidence proactively may cause information overload. Data reduction techniques are considered to reduce the huge amount of e-evidence. Data analysis is conducted to find the rate of data reduction.

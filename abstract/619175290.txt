Current service-oriented architecture (SOA) focuses on service composition for application development, i.e. application composition, which is perceived as volatile (i.e. "compose one time and use one time."). This paper focuses on service composition information (i.e. service dependency) management and dependency-aware service composition for service development (i.e. service composition). This paper explores service composition and service dependency by proposing an extended SOA model, including: 1) establishing a dependency-aware service-oriented architecture (DSOA) that specifies dependency-aware service interactions, i.e. service publication, discovery, composition and binding; 2) developing an upper service dependency ontology for non-volatile DSOA service composition; and 3) demonstrating the validation of DSOA service composition by implementing a DSOA service manager.

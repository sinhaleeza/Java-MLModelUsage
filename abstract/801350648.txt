Android system has been the crucial platform for the mobile service ecosystem. As a typical open source project, the release of the android system is a challenging issue because many developers are working on the related projects and it will affect millions of mobile service running on the platform. Therefore, investigating the release process of Android system is important for the mobile service ecosystem. Particularly, in this paper, we will focus on the release features prediction issue of what features should be included in the new publishing version. The valid changes and release notes are transformed into low-dimensional vectors and then the automatic labelling methodology is developed to detect the features. Combing with the time series forecasting model, an approach to predict the published features in the new version is presenting. Based on the data collected from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), the experiments show that: comparing with the state-of-the-art, our approach achieves 13.83% to 17.69% precision improvement in releasing feature predictions and we can effectively detect the spike features for further compatibility management.

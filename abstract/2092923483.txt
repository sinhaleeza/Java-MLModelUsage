Reusable software component repository (SCR) and retrieval management of components have long been in active research for many years. However, building interoperable SCRs is still a challenge for software engineering. Now, domain ontologies have been employed to manage software components, and the method has been deemed as an effective way to achieve the interoperability among different SCRs. Recently, ISO/IEC initiated a new standard (No. 19763) based on OMG MOF (meta-object facility) and ISO/IEC 11179 (MDR, metadata registry) to specify a framework for metamodel interoperability. According to the 3r part of the standard, viz. Metamodel for ontology registration, we developed a grid-oriented platform for ontology-based SCR. In this paper, we present the approach that implements the new standard, and introduce the design of architecture and core component of the platform, which has been successfully deployed in several software enterprises to facilitate producing software systems with software components. Eventually, we put forward the future work to solve the emergent problems when using the platform.

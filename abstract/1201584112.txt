Remote monitoring and intelligent intervention of machines are essentials in a smart industrial environment. However, the heterogeneity of machines makes it difficult to construct solutions for this purpose. This work aims to describe how to provide smart industrial environments using Smart Gateways, RESTful Web Services, and Cloud Computing. In the proposed solution, a Smart Gateway is responsible for representing a given machines' resources as RESTful Web Services for clients and Web applications, sending monitored data to a persistence service in a Cloud, while also allowing for the remote control of these machines. As a proof of concept, a smart industrial environment was developed from the considerations of a real case study at an apparel factory. Functional testing and performance evaluation confirmed the feasibility of the solution in this case study.

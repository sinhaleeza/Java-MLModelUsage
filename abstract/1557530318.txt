In this highly dynamic era of technology, most of the data-intensive applications are designed to target a good combination of high operation availabilities, scalability, consistency, fault tolerance etc. To address this issue, the research community has introduced many valuable techniques based on data replication and data distribution. However, in the ongoing research there is a paradigm shift: the research community is targeting to minimize the inter-application coordination - the coordination required to ensure consistency - to achieve high operation availabilities. In this work, we present, a Component-based Highly Available Replication Strategy (CbHaRS) which exploits operation types and hybrid communication model to achieve high operation availabilities. CbHaRS is highly scalable as it utilizes data components as the building blocks for the replication strategy. Causal data consistency in CbHaRS is ensured by a so-called component administrator. The Communication type between the data component and the component administrator depends upon the state of the data component. Additionally, the state of the data component depends upon the operation type. We further extend the concept of client specific on-demand replication to general component-based replication. CbHaRS is a project in progress. To prove the effectiveness of CbHaRS, we have implemented the CbHaRS prototype and discuss the achieved results.

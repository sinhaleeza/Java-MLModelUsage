Business Process Management (BPM) software provides visibility into business processes in organizations of all sizes and helps increase process efficiency continuously. However, the time and effort involved in modeling, deploying and executing a business process is tremendous and as a result organizations struggle to agilely adapt business processes to dynamic business requirements. On the other hand, the growing popularity of cloud computing poses opportunities and challenges on how business processes can leverage resource outsourcing and elasticity. In light of the above, this paper presents a business process management platform that assists business analysts lacking necessary programming expertise by automating manual steps and providing guidance and recommendations to quickly and efficiently design, implement, deploy and execute business processes in a hybrid cloud environment.

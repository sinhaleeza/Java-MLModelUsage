In order to naturally incorporate the information provided by Web services into the data integration systems, we propose a novel model, uniform query, to uniformly describe the data query/view and the semantic of information-providing Web services. With the proper matching algorithm we have implemented a prototype in which Web services act as normal data sources (e.g. RDF datasets), and data queries could be answered through dynamic invocation of matched services.

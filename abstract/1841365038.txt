Microservices is a flexible architectural style that has many advantages over the alternative monolithic style. These include better performance and scalability. It is particularly suitable, and widely adopted, for cloud-based applications, because in this architecture a software system consisting of a large suite of services of fine granularity, each running its own process and communicating with the others. However, programming such systems is more complex. In this paper we report on CIDE, an integrated software development environment that helps with this. CIDE supports programming in a novel agent-oriented language called CAOPLE and tests their execution in a cluster environment. We present the architecture of CIDE, discuss its design based on the principles of the DevOps software development methodology, and describe facilities that support continuous testing and seamless integration, two other advantages of Microservices.

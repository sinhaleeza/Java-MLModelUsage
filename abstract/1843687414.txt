Tracking the execution of composite Web services to identify and adjust their specification according to the current features of the environment is a challenging issue. The concept of views, as a dynamic snapshot over this specification according to a given context, is proposed in this paper. A view is used as a support means for tracking the execution progress of composite Web services and deploying the corrective measures in case of non-compliance with users' requirements. Our contributions are a definition of what a view means in the context of Web services composition, an approach for specifying user context and its respective view, and mechanisms for extracting and visualizing views over specifications of composite services.

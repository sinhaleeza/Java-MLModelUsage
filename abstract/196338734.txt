Cloud broker is an entity that manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services and negotiates relationships between cloud providers and cloud consumers. In real life scenarios, automated cloud service brokering is often challenging because the service descriptions may involve complex constraints and require flexible semantic matching. Furthermore, cloud providers often use non-standard formats leading to semantic interoperability issues. In this paper, we formulate cloud service brokering under a service oriented framework, and propose a novel OWL-S based semantic cloud service discovery and selection system. The proposed system supports dynamic semantic matching of cloud services described with complex constraints. We consider a practical cloud service brokering scenario, and show with detailed illustration that our system is promising for real-life applications.

To achieve workflow retrieving and compliance checking based on behavior, it is necessary to identify the behavioral profiles of workflow models. Since the execution timing and the occurrence probability of tasks are crucial to choose appropriate workflows, it is significant to conduct exact quantitative analysis on the ordering relations by considering the time constraints and occurrence probabilities of tasks in workflow models. In this paper, the quantitative ordering relations are formally defined and an algorithm is proposed to efficiently compute the ordering relations with time and probability constraints based on complete firing sequences. Experiments show that the algorithm works well.

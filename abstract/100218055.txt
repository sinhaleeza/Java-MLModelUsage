In the field of data mining, most of necessary resources, such as datasets, computing resources, might be distributed in different places of the world, which impedes scientists to do research successfully. Service science advocates every available resource as a service and focuses on their collaboration to settle a problem. Here, we propose a service-based architecture for data mining applications, including configuration service, service engine, monitor service, analysis service, visualization service, computing service and data &amp; algorithm provision service. The first 5 services focus on 5 specific aspects of data mining requirements. A demo system has also been developed to validate the feasibility of our architecture.

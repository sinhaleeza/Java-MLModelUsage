A framework is proposed to improve Web service performance based on context-aware communication. Two key ideas are introduced to represent a client context: (1) available protocols that the client can handle, and (2) operation usage that shows how the client uses Web service operations. We call our context aware approach a situated Web service (SiWS). We implemented and evaluated the SiWS and found that the overall performance was improved if more than three Web services were executed between context changes

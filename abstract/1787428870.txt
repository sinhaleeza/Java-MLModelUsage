Near Field Communication (NFC) is a new short-range wireless communication technology that enabled simple, security and intuitive peer-to-peer communication between NFC-enabled devices. The advent of NFC has given rise to several interesting applications under short-range radio technology. Among the interesting applications, mobile payment is the first application in the marketplace. In the research, we proposed NFC-Micro SD technology, a new technology in NFC field. The new technology creates a more convenient environment and lower threshold for mobile payment to enter in. The collaborative mobile payment solution follows the original security mechanism of the traditional credit cards operation, and improve the value of the partners in the collaborative value chain, included the hardware produced and software development. The two modes, passive mode and active mode, provided by NFC-Micro SD technology also provide the reliable transaction for the mobile payment. In summary, the NFC mobile payment solution via NFC-Micro SD technology improves the higher acceptance, using willingness, and loyalty of the partners and users. It also makes the value chain as the collaborative solution. Thus, the NFC mobile payment via NFC-Micro SD technology can be seen as the better mobile payment solution and will lead the development of the mobile payment market.

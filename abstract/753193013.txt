Distributed software systems are the basis for innovative applications. Agility is the key for achieving survivable and maintainable distributed systems because the non-deterministic nature of distribution would otherwise leave the system uncontrollable, especially in emerging mobile ad-hoc networks. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is based on a self-organizing and rapidly deployed network of mobile services that collaborate without using any preexisting fixed network infrastructure. Survivability is defined as the capability of a service to fulfill its mission in a timely manner, even in the presence of attacks, threats, or failures. Any failure of a single system may affect a business process; however, the monitoring of many mobile services simultaneously is not an easy task. This paper bridges the analyses of business processes and security threats with an alert mechanism. We propose an integrated approach to engineer a survivable distributed system through dynamic workflow generation in the context of Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL), and Really Simple Syndication (RSS).

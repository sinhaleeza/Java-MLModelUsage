One of the fundamental pillars of the Web service vision is a brokerage system that enables services to be published to a searchable repository and later retrieved by potential users. This is the basic motivation for the UDDI standard, one of the three standards underpinning current Web service technology. However, this aspect of the technology has been the least successful, and the few Web sites that today attempt to provide a Web service brokerage facility do so using a simple cataloguing approach rather than UDDI. In this paper we analyze why the brokerage aspect of the Web service vision has proven so difficult to realize in practice and outline the technical difficulties involved in setting up and maintaining useful repositories of Web services. We then describe a pragmatic approach to web service brokerage based on automated indexing and discuss the required technological foundations. We also suggest some ideas for improving the existing standards to better support this approach and Web service searching in general.

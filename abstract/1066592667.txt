In this paper we present a generic public administration (PA) domain ontology. We define a formal model for a public administration service on the basis of the Web service modeling ontology (WSMO). For this purpose we employ the generic public service object model of the governance enterprise architecture (GEA) providing PA domain specific semantics. We describe the ontology using the Web service modeling language (WSML). This domain ontology is implemented in order to be used in semantic Web services architecture for e-government.

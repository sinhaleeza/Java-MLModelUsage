As an emerging interdisciplinary subject which crosscuts business modeling, knowledge management and economic analysis, service engineering is increasingly demanded to take care of various stakeholders' proting goals of the short run vs. long run. We propose to work towards a value driven design based solution through introducing a form of service design patterns: the service value broker (SVB) patterns to shorten the distance from economical analysis to IT implementation. SVB patterns allow us to not only study the value added in terms of functional and business aspects, but also reason about the need for brokerage across various domains.

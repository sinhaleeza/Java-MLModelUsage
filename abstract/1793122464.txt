Growing numbers of users and many access policies in service-oriented environments cause various problems in protecting resource. In this paper we analyze the relationships of resource attributes to user attributes in all policies, and propose a general attribute based role-based access control (GARBAC) model. The proposed model introduces the notions of composition permission and single attribute expression and composite attribute expression, defines a set of rules based on different attribute expression to assign users to roles. The model is a general access control model, and can support many access control policies, and also can be used to wider application for service.

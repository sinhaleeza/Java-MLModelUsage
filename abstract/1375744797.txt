Incorporating code mobility to inter-operable internet enabled software applications improves efficiency, performance and network traffic reduction. Present mobile agent technology fails to leverage the interoperable web infrastructure developed in a standard compliant manner. Here we describe a development environment and technology that fuse Workflow, Web 2.0, SOA and WS-BPEL and create a distributed computing environment (ACtive E-commerce Framework called ACEF) that permit creation of inter operable, infrastructure leveraging migratable code for design of active internet applications.

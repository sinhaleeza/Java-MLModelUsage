Mobile agent technology has been evolving since late 1990s and its development is essentially independent of developments in distributed computing technology such as SOA, Semantic web and Web services. Incorporating mobile agents bring undeniable benefits to a distributed application. Present mobile agent technology fails to leverage the interoperable web infrastructure developed in a standard compliant manner. Here we fuse Workflow, Web 2.0, SOA and WS-BPEL and create a distributed computing environment (ACtive E-commerce Framework called ACEF) that permit creation of inter operable, infrastructure leveraging migratable code for design of active internet application.

In service oriented computing paradigm (SOC), services can be composed dynamically to fulfill complex needs. In the literature, the problem of service choreography has been widely studied. The existing approaches assume that only one instance of each involved service is required. This assumption is very restrictive since in a choreography, multiple instances of each service may be required. To handle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel instance-aware service choreography approach. The aim is to enable automatic service composition through a choreography where the service instances are defined dynamically.

The growing popularity of service oriented computing based on Web services standards is creating a need for paradigms to represent and design business processes. Significant work has been done in the representation aspects with regards to WSBPEL. However, design and modeling of business processes is still an open issue. In this paper, we present a novel designer for business processes, which allows for intuitive modeling of Web processes, as well as using a template based approach for semi-automatically integrating partners either at design time or at deployment time. This work has been done as part of the METEOR-S project, which concentrates on adding semantics to the entire Web process lifecycle.

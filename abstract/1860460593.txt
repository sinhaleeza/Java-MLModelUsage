In manufacturing organizations is difficult to reach the requirements of the new business models (agile and dynamic adaptation to changes) due to technological and conceptual constraints between elements located at different levels of the organization, which prevents the integration of business and manufacturing processes. In this paper, a new industrial machinery model that achieves this integration has been proposed. This model, named IMaaS, shows the industrial machinery as a set of business processes, removing the conceptual constraints, and exposed as services, removing technology constraints.

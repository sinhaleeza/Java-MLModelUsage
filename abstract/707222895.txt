Care processes in healthcare organizations are very complex and difficult to define precisely in advance. Furthermore, a specific process for the same disease can vary according to the characteristics of a patient and his or her situation at hand. In order to provide personalized healthcare services to patients, it is essential to identify the context of the patients. This paper presents an integrated architecture of context-aware business process management system based on ubiquitous computing technologies. By detecting the current health status of a patient using various ubiquitous devices such as RFID and smart sensors, the proposed system helps healthcare professionals provide personalized healthcare services.

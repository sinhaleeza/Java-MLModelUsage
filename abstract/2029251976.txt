Large-scale scientific data management and analysis usually relies on many distributed scientists with diverse expertise. In recent years, such a collaborative effort is often composed and automated into a dataflow-oriented process, a so-called scientific workflow. However, existing scientific workflow tools are single user-oriented and do not support collaborative scientific workflow composition, execution, and management among multiple distributed scientists. In this paper, we report our study of collaboration protocols towards building a tool supporting collaborative scientific workflow composition. Based on a scientific collaboration ontology, we propose a collaboration model supported by a set of collaboration primitives and patterns. The collaboration protocols are then applied to support effective concurrency control in the process of collaborative workflow composition.

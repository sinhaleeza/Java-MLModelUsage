We introduce BlueInfo, an open architecture for deploying Web services in WPAN hotspots for cost-free context-aware mobile access over Bluetooth. A BlueInfo hotspot either pushes subscribed services at desired intervals to registered devices (BlueInfo Push) or alternatively the user invokes a particular service by sending a simple keyword query to the hotspot (BlueInfo Pull). The BlueInfo hotspot requests the service from the origin server in the Internet and relays the response to the mobile device, possibly after adaptation for mobile viewing. The usability of BlueInfo Pull in comparison to a mobile phone browser is demonstrated with an empirical user evaluation conducted in a laboratory setting.

Online Social Network (OSN) services are very popular nowadays. In order to protect the data privacy, Decentralized Online Social Network (DOSN) services have been proposed. In DOSN, the data published by a user and the data replicas are only stored in the friend circle of the user. Although full replication can improve Data Availability (DA), pure DOSNs may not be able to deliver sustainable data availability. This paper proposes a Cloud-Assisted scheme, called Cadros, to improve the DA in DOSN. This paper conducts quantitative analysis about the storage capacity of Cadros as the result of integrating the Cloud into DOSN, and further models and predicts the level of DA that Cadros can achieve. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of Cadros.

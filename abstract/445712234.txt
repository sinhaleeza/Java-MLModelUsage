Service-oriented Computing (SOC) has become one of the most preferred distributed computing paradigms which utilize services as elements for designing and developing application systems. In SOC, consumers who have different functional and non-functional requirements might consume services offered by various providers. Faced with the increasing number of Web services and the diversity of service consumers' requirements, how to select and customize service models to satisfy consumers' personalized requirements remains an important issue. To this end, we adopt a model-driven development approach to customize services based on service feature modeling (SFM). Since SFM builds upon feature modeling (FM), it inherits the advantages of the latter. Furthermore, it takes into account service consumers' non-functional requirements with the attributes and attributes type that are not considered in the general feature model technique. A prototype shows the feasibility of the proposed approach.

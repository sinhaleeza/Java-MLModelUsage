Context awareness in Web services is gaining momentum. Since it is not a trivial task, it suffers from lack of a general solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for context-aware semantic Web services which is applicable for any environment. It is established based on composition of context provider Web services and other context-aware semantic Web services. In addition, an extended version of the semantic Web service ontology language for semantic Web services is introduced, in order to make it possible to find appropriate context-aware semantic Web services based on available context information. So as to make it applicable for any environment, the solution does not hold any assumption about the user's context source. Rather, the property of context level is defined.

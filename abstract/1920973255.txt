Increasing the productivity of Service-Oriented Software Engineering through a model-driven methodology needs to go beyond business service modeling and the automation of transforming models that adhere to the SOA style. Commonly, business analysts focus on modeling business processes. Then, IT developers implement software architectures that are automatically generated from the process models. In this paper, we look forward to maintaining the alignment between business services and their supporting IT assets when business settings evolve. We introduce an approach for an incremental synchronization between business process models and component configuration models that follow SOA architectural principles. We automate the change forward propagation by enforcing in-place translations of the updates on the models in order to preserve their consistency.

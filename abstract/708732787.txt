Cluster computing has become popular in academia and industry. Clusters of commodity servers are used for a variety of distributed applications like simulation, data analysis, and web services. No single framework can fit every distributed application. Even an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) like the Openstack cloud framework cannot fit all of them because, for example, some researchers would likely want to deploy hadoop clusters on bare metal servers. One solution to this problem is to assign a layer below the IaaS/PaaS (Platform as a Service) layer the job of handling cluster deployment. This idea is called the Cluster-as-a-Service layer for allocating servers and deploying IaaS and PaaS. This paper introduces dodai-deploy, which handles Cluster as a Service deployments.

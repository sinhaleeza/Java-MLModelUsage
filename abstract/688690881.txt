Intermediaries for e-services continuously gain momentum, powered by a materializing Internet of Services. However, quality of service still exhibits considerable shortcomings, as no structured process to enhance consumer satisfaction is available yet. To improve the match of delivered e-service quality and expected service quality on the consumer side, we develop a portfolio optimization process that integrates both, the consumer's as well as the intermediary's perspective. First, we introduce a toolkit for an e-service oriented gap analysis. Thereupon, we identify monitoring points to measure service quality gaps automatically. A subsequent aggregation of measured data into customized feedback information allows for applying the toolkit to continuously optimize e-service portfolios. Instantiated in the AGORA e-service market, we conclude with a report on our recent implementation results.

Service creation specifies and generates the model of a SOA application, which drives the subsequent activities in the SOA development lifecycle. Contemporary service creation is mostly done manually. Ontology technology can enhance the degree of automation and semantics of service creation, however, most works on ontology focus on ontology usage in fields other than software service development. This paper proposes an ontology based service creation process framework to apply ontology really for software service development. An ontology system that facilitates reuse in service creation process was designed, a four-phase service creation process was proposed, and a shipping case was carried out on our service creation tool to show the increasing service reuse rate under the ontology based service creation process framework.

The service composition execution engine- WebJetFlow with dual feedback control loops, which separates process executor and service proxy to decouple process execution and service invocation, is designed and implemented. The experiment results show that the feedback control mechanism enables WebJetFlow to provide response time guarantee for differentiated processes even when workload varies significantly, and the decoupling method increases the throughput of WebJetFlow.

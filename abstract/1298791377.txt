In the context of genome research, the method of gene expression analysis has been used for several years. Related microarray experiments are conducted all over the world, and consequently, a vast amount of microarray data sets are produced. Having access to this variety of repositories, researchers would like to incorporate this data in their analyses to increase the statistical significance of their results. In this paper, we present our service-oriented approach for the gene expression analysis. Our approach is oriented towards scalability and efficiency.

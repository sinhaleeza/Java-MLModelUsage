Presents an editorial which explores the market fr cloud-based mobile computing systems. The concept of cloud-based mobile applications has emerged recently to address the limitations of pure mobile applications by leveraging the vast resources available at computing clouds. Traditionally, mobile applications benefit by outsourcing a part of the program execution to a cloud-based system to compute the (intermediate) results and send back these results for integration by the relevant mobile application. By doing so, the program code, data as well as device-specific information, such as user locations, can be made available to a cloud. Infrastructures to support computation outsourcing of the above type and its variants have been widely studied; and the associated security and privacy issues are hot topics in research.

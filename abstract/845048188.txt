In this paper, we examine the online authentication method based on Merkle (hash) tree focusing on its reliability. Coming from side channels in online authentication, the effectiveness runs into danger in the long run. With consideration of effectiveness, we present a Merkle tree based online authentication resilient against side channels by obfuscating authentication proofs. Security and efficiency are analyzed to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach.

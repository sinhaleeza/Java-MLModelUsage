In this paper we discuss a model-based approach to verifying process interactions for coordinated Web service compositions. The approach uses finite state machine representations of Web service orchestrations and assigns semantics to the distributed process interactions. The move towards implementing Web service compositions by multiple interested parties as a form of distributed system architecture motivates the need for supporting compatibility verification of activities and transactions in all the processes. The described approach is supported by a suite of cooperating tools for specification, formal modeling and providing verification results from orchestrated Web service interactions.

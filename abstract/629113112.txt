Web services are the main pillar of the service oriented computing (SOC) paradigm which enables the application integration within and across business organizations. One of the important features of the Web services is the choreography aspect which allows to capture collaborative processes involving multiple services. In this context, one of the important investigations is the choreography compatibility analysis. We mean by the choreography compatibility the capability of a set of Web services of actually interacting by exchanging messages in a proper manner. Whether a set of services are compatible depends not only on their sequences of messages but also on quantitative properties such as timed properties. In this paper, we investigate a model checking based approach that deals with checking the compatibility of a choreography in which the Web services support asynchronous timed communications. Particularly, in this paper we are using the model checker UPPAAL. We propose a set of required abstractions that allow to use the model checker UPPAAL to deal with timed asynchronous communicating services.

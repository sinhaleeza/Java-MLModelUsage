Gaining visibility into their retail supply chain has become a top priority for the Consumer Product (CP) industry. However, taking a “do-it-yourself” approach to the problem is proving to be both expensive and complex. Cloud Computing, with its on-demand provisioning capability on shared resources, has emerged as a new paradigm to address the challenges of the CP industry. In this paper, we describe a framework for deployment of business analytic solutions on a Cloud platform. We illustrate the benefits of the approach in context of the Demand Driven Business Analytic solution that provides demand signals to CP manufacturers.

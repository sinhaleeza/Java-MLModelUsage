Software applications that are provided through services following the Software as a service (SaaS) paradigm generally need to be compliant to some standards. In order to select the software application that provides the most conformant service interface, we develop a formal framework that tests the compliance and reports quantitative results that help experts to take the right decision. Unlike existing work that focuses on a single dimension when checking the compliance of a software application with the corresponding standard (for example the functional dimension exclusively, or the syntactic dimension exclusively), in this work we consider multiple dimensions at the same time. This provides more comprehensive results. We implemented a prototype and we tested our framework on a case study regarding the selection of software applications for our collaborative platform.

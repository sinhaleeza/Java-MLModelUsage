With the rapid development of service-oriented computing (SOC) and service-oriented architecture (SOA), the number of services is rapidly increasing. How to organize and manage services effectively in repositories to improve the efficiency of service discovery and composition is important. This paper proposes three categorization rules to classify services for a large scale repository to form a relational taxonomy. The service retrieve scope can be drastically narrowed by this taxonomy. Therefore, the efficiency of service discovery and service composition can be greatly improved. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method and other related ones via a publicly available test set, ICEBE05. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed one.

While end-users enjoy the data service mashup with high convenience and flexibility, how to achieve the best performance with minimum maintenance cost is a challenging problem. In this paper, the data maintenance problem is analyzed, and the maintenance cost model for the data service mashup is built. The model measures the response cost and update cost of a group of data service mashups in terms of the request frequency and update frequency. Experiment shows our mashup platform with the model can reduce data maintenance cost.

An important challenge in today's software development domain is to integrate diverse development tools. In this paper we present a method that combine various modeling languages which underline a set of steps for the purpose of specifying tool integration, and then establish tool chains above the Service cloud and provide these tools as Services. A case study from the embedded system development area is used to exemplify the method, highlighting the benefits and challenges of establishing tool chains above the service cloud.

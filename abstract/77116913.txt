The development of enterprise-wide service-oriented architectures (SOA) is a complex task. In most cases, evolutionary approaches are used to deal with the arising complexity. However, most of the existing design methodologies and implementation strategies focus on more technical, service realization specific aspects. Challenges regarding the definition and the management of related service artifacts throughout the whole service lifecycle are neglected. Also the implementation of a lifecycle-encompassing information management infrastructure is not addressed adequately in research and industry. In this paper we introduce a common service management information model (coSIM) that builds a foundation for the management of services and service infrastructures during design-, run- , and change-time.

Emerging grid applications desire not only high bandwidth but also the ability to control the topology and traffic engineering of the underlying networks, through Web service interfaces. To achieve that goal, we present an advanced user controlled lightpath provisioning (UCLP) system, where network resources and grid resources are both modeled as Web services and are seamlessly integrated into workflows.

Multi-tenant service-based systems (SBSs) have gained unprecedented prominence in recent years. Network-accessible Web services are composed in the form of business process to simultaneously fulfill multiple tenants' functional and multi-dimensional quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Those services often operate in a distributed and volatile environment. It is of tremendous importance to monitor the services to detect or predict the anomalies timely to avoid QoS violations and Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches. However, monitoring Web services consumes resources and incurs system overhead. It is impractical to constantly monitor all the services in an SBS. Thus, it is a significant challenge to monitor the services of a multi-tenant SBS in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we propose CM4MTS (Criticality-based Monitoring for Multi-Tenant SBSs) for formulating cost-effective monitoring strategy. The criticality of a service is evaluated based on its impacts on the quality of the SBS upon runtime anomalies and the tenants sharing the service. The services with higher criticalities in an SBS are given higher priorities in monitoring resource allocation. Extensive experiments show that CM4MTS outperforms representative approaches in ensuring the quality of multi-tenant SBSs.

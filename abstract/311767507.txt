This paper describes an architectural framework adopting the principles of service oriented architecture for deploying unified communications over the Internet. Also discuss the possible ecosystem based on this approach, and the business model that could probably emerge using such a model. In this architecture, we explore the benefits of the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) framework for providing us with an ideal service execution platform on the servers, with subscriber client devices on the Internet deploying their services dynamically on them. With a cluster of such networks, we form a distributed communication network for different regions of deployment, with an interaction model between them.

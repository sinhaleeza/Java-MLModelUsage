Web service recommendation has become a critical problem as services become increasingly prevalent on the Internet. Some existing methods focus on content matching techniques such as keyword search and semantic matching while others are based on Quality of Service (QoS) prediction. However, services and their mashups are evolving over time with publishing, perishing and changing of interfaces. Therefore, a practical service recommendation approach should take into account the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we present a method to extract service evolution patterns by exploiting Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and time series prediction. A time-aware service recommendation framework for mashup creation is presented combing service evolution, collaborative filtering and content matching. Experiments on real-world ProgrammableWeb data set show that our approach leads to a higher precision than traditional collaborative filtering and content matching methods.

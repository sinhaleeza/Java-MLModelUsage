Service-oriented architecture (SOA) promotes a paradigm where ad-hoc applications are built by dynamically linking service-based software capabilities. Service providers follow specification standards to advertise their services' capabilities and to enable loosely coupled integration between their services and other businesses over the Web. A major challenge in this domain is interpreting the data that must be marshaled between consumer and producer systems. We propose a framework to support formal modeling and contracts for data-centric Web services. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to verify correctness properties for composition of services.

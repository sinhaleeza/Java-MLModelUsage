We study the problem of synthesis of a choreographer in Web service composition for a given set of services and a goal. Services and goal are represented using I/O automata which can succinctly and precisely describe the interfaces of the services. Our technique considers existence and synthesis of two types of the choreographers: a simple choreographer capable of only relaying outputs from one service to input of another and a transducing choreographer which is capable of storing and reusing inputs/outputs from the services. The central theme of our technique relies on generating I/O automata representation of all possible choreographed behavior of existing services (captured in form of universal service automaton, a concept introduced in this paper) and verifying that the goal can be simulated by the universal set of choreographed behaviors.

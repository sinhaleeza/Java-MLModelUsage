The linkage between healthcare service and cloud computing techniques has drawn much attention lately. Up to the present, most works focus on IT system migration and the management of distributed healthcare data rather than taking advantage of information hidden in the data. In this paper, we propose to explore healthcare data via cloud-based healthcare data mining services. Specifically, we propose a cloud-based healthcare data mining framework for healthcare data mining service development. Under such framework, we further develop a cloud-based healthcare data mining service to predict patients future length of stay in hospital.

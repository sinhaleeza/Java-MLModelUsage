Timed properties are an important quality criterion in Business-to-Business (B2B) Web service compositions. To guarantee the correctness of these compositions, the deadlock freeness as well as some non-functional properties such as timed constraints should be satisfied. Since there are some recent research efforts concerning the correctness of service composition from the structural and behavioral compatibility perspective, this paper will mainly focus on the timed properties verification. Existing verification techniques however need to know all the activities and activities' time delays of the whole process, thus these techniques are infeasible when some business parties are unwilling to reveal their internal process for privacy or business reasons. To address this problem, a timing property preserving public view approach is proposed. By composing those public views published by all the participants, timed verification can be conducted so that business parties can identify suitable services that meet their timed requirements. A case study of B2B collaboration is included to illustrate our approach.

We propose a methodology for designing Web services. The methodology is founded on Tropos (Perini et al., 2001 and Castro, et al., 2002), an agent-oriented software development technique, and supports early and late requirements analysis, as well as architectural and detailed design. An online retailer example is used for illustration of the proposed methodology. We also compare the generated design with a sample design presented in [BPT01].

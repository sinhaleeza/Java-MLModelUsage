End-users conduct various on-line activities. Quite often they re-visit websites and use services to perform repeated activities, such as on-line shopping. The end-users are required to enter the same information into various web services to accomplish such repeated tasks. Typing redundant information repetitively into such services negatively impacts the user experience. In this study, we propose an approach to prevent end-users from such unnecessary interruption. Our approach propagates user inputs across services by linking similar input and output parameters. Our approach also pre-fills values to the input parameters which could not be filled by the values from other input or output parameters. We propose a meta-data model for storing user inputs and an Input Parameter Context Model for identifying similar input or output parameters. We have implemented our approach and evaluated it on the real world services through an empirical study. Our overall approach can reduce on average 37% of input parameters through the execution of composed services.

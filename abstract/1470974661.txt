Service oriented computing (SOC) has provided a promising architectural for business collaboration. However challenging security issues concerning business collaboration have arisen because of its dynamic and loosely coupling nature. An important problem is how to specify security policies that belong to different application domains and integrate them to satisfy the requirements of the collaboration. In this paper we will provide analysis on authorization policy requirements for business collaboration, collaboration patterns and various security comparability and integration issues. We believe it is a first step toward a framework for modeling, specifying and handling authorization control for business collaboration.

The concept of trust in web services mainly deals with the degree of belief that a client or a group of clients have over services functioning satisfactorily and providing the expected results. With services being invoked in composition with each other, computing the trust of the composition and selecting services that deliver the highest trust for it becomes a desired goal. In this paper we demonstrate how using Bayesian networks and its supporting queries, we can select the set of services among all candidates that would provide highest global trust.

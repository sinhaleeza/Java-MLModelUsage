The sensor as a service is an emerging application of the services computing. However, how to implement such sensor services efficiently and reliably is an open issue. This paper presents an application framework, called Sensor Service Framework (SSF), that supports developers to build and deploy sensor services in the home network system (HNS). The SSF prescribes device-neutral features and APIs for the sensor devices to be deployed as Web services. Writing a small amount of code with the SSF, the developer can easily deploy any sensor device as a service in the HNS. The sensor service can provide a standardized access to heterogeneous sensor devices, as well as a context management service with user-defined conditions. We then present a sensor mashup platform (SMuP), which allows the dynamic composition of the existing sensor services. To support non-expert developers, we also implemented a GUI front-end, called Sensor Service Binder (SSB). The proposed technologies are implemented and evaluated in an actual HNS to demonstlate practical feasibility.

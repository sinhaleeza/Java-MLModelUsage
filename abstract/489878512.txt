Interface mismatches are common among web services interactions. It happens when the interacting services have different message signatures. Semantic Web technologies are proposed to address this problem. If services are annotated with shared ontologies, an interface adapter may be generated by connecting messages that annotated with same or similar concepts. Unfortunately, services are usually annotated with different ontologies. As a result, different ontologies need to be aligned before adaptation. Aligning large ontologies can be time-consuming and inaccurate, which leads to inefficient and unsuccessful web service adaptation. In this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing a sub-ontology extraction method to generate Representation Ontology for each service. The Representation Ontologies can significantly increase alignment speed and accuracy, which consequently improve the process of interface adapter generation. Related tests are conducted to evaluate our work.

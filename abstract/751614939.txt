Business process optimization can provide direct benefits to achieve business goals by improving predetermined objectives. In this paper, we study the properties of time performance and develop approaches to optimize it in work flow based business processes. By applying our data-centric business process modeling techniques, we explore the possibility of reconstructing business process that is realized by modifying the execution order of business activities. Accordingly, we develop efficient algorithms to approach optimal time performance for both a single subprocess and an overall business process.

IEEE 
Transactions on Services Computing
 and INFORMS 
Service Science
 issued a joint call for papers targeting the bridging of service perspectives from business (e.g., service science, services marketing and information systems) to services computing. The intent was to advance transdisciplinary research agendas that could generate advances that go beyond the sum of independent research streams. As with all transdisciplinary research ideals, these efforts are extremely difficult, as pioneers need to overcome significant barriers, including different vocabularies, different research methods and differences in each field's historical evolution. This special section provides a snapshot of research efforts that begin to break down barriers. We offer special thanks to those authors who took the risk of having their manuscripts processed by an esteemed set of invited guest editors who have expertise from across the services spectrum.

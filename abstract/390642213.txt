Web service has emerged as a new solution for enterprise application integration. Automatic service composite algorithm is to build a composite service for user's request or complex business requirement. Most former work uses the dependence among services, however the relationship is often complicated and the composition algorithm is time consuming. This paper proposes a type based service composition algorithm, which can calculate a feasible solution in linear time. We conduct a series of experiments with real dataset and generated data. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method.

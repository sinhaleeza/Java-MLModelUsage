This paper analyzes the execution behavior of web services on devices with limited resources. The experiments compare web services in the Axis2 and CXF frameworks analyzing performance and power consumption. To determine which framework is better suited for service provision, a testing environment and a performance and energy evaluation between them are presented. We show that the Raspberry Pi can be useful in service-oriented applications for different types of tasks. Bringing together the best features of small devices and SoC, it is possible to provide diverse, mobile and green applications.

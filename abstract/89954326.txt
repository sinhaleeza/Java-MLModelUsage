Environments in which Web service compositions (WSC) operate are often dynamic. We address the problem of which service to query for up-to-date information in order to adapt a hierarchical WSC, given that queries are not free. Previously,the value of changed information (VOC) has been proposed to select those services for querying whose revised non-functional information is expected to bring about the most change in the composition. In this paper, we present an approach for utilizing VOC in the context of a WSC composed of services and lower level WSCs, which induces a natural hierarchy over the composition.

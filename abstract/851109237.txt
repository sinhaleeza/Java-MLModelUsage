Nowadays, more and more distributed digital TV and TV-related resources are published on the Web, such as Electronic Personal TV Guide (EPG) data. To enable applications to access these resources easily, the TV resource data is commonly provided by Web service technologies. The huge variety of data related to the TV domain and the wide range of services that provide it, raises the need to have a broker to discover, select and orchestrate services to satisfy the runtime requirements of applications that invoke these services. The variety of data and heterogeneous nature of the service capabilities makes it a challenging domain for automated web-service discovery and composition. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-stage service annotation approach, which is resolved by integrating Linked Services and IRS-III semantic web services framework, to complete the lifecycle of service annotating, publishing, deploying, discovering, orchestration and dynamic invocation. This approach satisfies both developer's and application's requirements to use Semantic Web Services (SWS) technologies manually and automatically.

This work is motivated by the increasing importance and business value of data in the fields of business process management, scientific workflows as a field in eScience, and Internet of Things, all of which profiting from the recent advances in data science and Big data. We introduce a management life cycle that renders data as first-class citizen in service choreographies and defines the functions and artifacts necessary for enabling transparent and efficient data exchange among choreography participants. The inherent goal of the life cycle, functions and artifacts is to help decouple the data flow, data exchange and management from the control flow in service compositions and choreographies. This decoupling enables peer-to-peer data exchange in choreographies and provides the means for more sophisticated data management and exchange, as well as data exchange and provisioning optimization.

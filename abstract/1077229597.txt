The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) grid application platform provides a grid environment for CFD applications using high performance computing. It adopts service oriented architecture (SOA), is based on IBM's Service Domain, extends and customizes it for CFD applications in several modules, such as service requesting, job scheduling, job management, failure recovery, etc. By defining general CFD application interfaces such as data format, the platform integrates different CFD applications, including mesh generation, domain decomposition and resolvers, to follow the workflow customized by end-users to finish a complete CFD job. Furthermore, CFD application development specifications and packages are provided to facilitate migrating most sequential and parallel CFD applications to the platform. Currently, a prototype system is available online to the public for testing.

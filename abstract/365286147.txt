Data-intensive applications are calling for (1) significant performance improvement in data processing, and (2) lowered entries for domain expertise to create higher value. Pursuing a database approach to the challenges, the paper presents an automated database extension mechanism, which allows one to seamlessly program application level workflows, and computations to be pushed down to (heterogeneous) database systems, in one programming language. We thus greatly ease the job of implementing scalable data intensive computations, with multiple databases as the computation platform.

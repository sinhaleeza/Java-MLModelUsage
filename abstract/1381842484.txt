Quality of Web Service (QoWS) support for Mobility-aware Web services (MWS) is critical for mobile users since it relies on the available resources on mobile devices consuming these services. In this paper, we propose a selection model for MWS based on QoWS and device resources requirements. The main purpose of the model is to support the client in selecting MWS based on desired QoWS as well as on its device resources availability. We propose a verification scheme to verify the conformity of claimed MWS QoWS and required device resources compared to the published one. The verification is used to support selection of MWS. The implementation of our model is discussed and the importance of our verification scheme is highlighted.

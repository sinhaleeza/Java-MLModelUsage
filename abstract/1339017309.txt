In cloud service provisioning scenarios with a changing demand from consumers, it is appealing for cloud providers to leverage only a limited amount of the virtualized resources required to provide the service. However, it is not easy to determine how much resources are required to satisfy consumers expectations in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Some existing frameworks provide mechanisms to adapt the required cloud resources in the service delivery, also called an elastic service, but only for consumers with the same QoS expectations. The problem arises when the service provider must deal with several consumers, each demanding a different QoS for the service. In such an scenario, cloud resources provisioning must deal with trade-offs between different QoS, while fulfilling these QoS, within the same service deployment. In this paper we propose an elasticity-aware governance platform for cloud service delivery that reacts to the dynamic service load introduced by consumers demand. Such a reaction consists of provisioning the required amount of cloud resources to satisfy the different QoS that is offered to the consumers by means of several service level agreements. The proposed platform aims to keep under control the QoS experienced by multiple service consumers while maintaining a controlled cost.

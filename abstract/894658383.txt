In the modern service industry, both service processes and data structures are becoming increasingly diverse and complex. In addition, interdependences exist among data, such that the use of "shoe size" data must be based on the "type of goods" data returning "shoe". This is also observed for the functions and interfaces in a system, as one can use the function "order payment" only after the function "order generation". This kind of phenomenon is rather common in service systems nowadays, especially when the service is a transboundary service such as the new retail proposed by Jack Ma. Traditional modeling methods have difficulties in handling such scenarios. There have been studies on service modeling over the past several years, and they have focused mainly on the service processes and interactions among services. In this work, we construct MeCo-TSM based on three sub-models to handle multi-entity complex service process. We verify our model in the real processes of our cooperation company and compare it with related works. MeCo-TSM supports the service better in our cases and shows satisfactory efficiency, effectiveness and reusability.

In this paper, we first analyze the urgent needs of training service skills in a global environment. We then analyze the different patterns that 3D virtual world technologies can help learning activities. Instead of using the well known MVC model for Web application development, we propose a new design pattern for designing 3D virtual world learning applications named PWI model based on our own accumulated experience.

The increasing use of the Web for everyday tasks is making Web services an essential part of the Internet customer's daily life. Users query the Internet for a required Web service and get back a set of Web services that may or may not satisfy their request. To get the most relevant Web services that fulfill the user's request, the user has to construct the request using the keywords that best describe the user's objective and match correctly with the Web Service name or location. Clustering Web services based on function similarities would greatly boost the ability of Web services search engines to retrieve the most relevant Web services. This paper proposes a novel technique to mine Web Service Description Language (WSDL) documents and cluster them into functionally similar Web service groups. The application of our approach to real Web services description files has shown good performance for clustering Web services based on function similarity, as a predecessor step to retrieving the relevant Web services for a user request by search engines.

In recent times, automated business processes and web service technologies have become popular and ubiquitous for catering to diverse user needs. While providing a service, the service providers are typically expected to furnish promised QoS values for the services they deliver. However, when the services are physically deployed and invoked during a query resolution, these parameter values vary largely depending on different factors like network load, number of applications running in the server etc. In this work, we present a stochastic model of the web service composition problem. Experimental results on Web Service Challenge (WSC) benchmarks show the efficiency of our proposed mechanism.

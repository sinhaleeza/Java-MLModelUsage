EURO-NGI's main target is creating and maintaining the most prominent European centre of excellence in next generation Internet design and engineering. A specific objective of the EURO-NGI Network is the development of a Macro-Tool which provides a homogeneous environment for hosting and interrelation of the software tools developed by the research labs of the network. This paper proposes tool integration under a common user access interface as an optimal solution and proposes the Web interface as the most natural option. The paper explains several innovative aspects in the field of remote software tool execution, secure access, customized interfaces and sharing environments. WeBaSeRex is the resulting sharing environment for network planning tools based on these ideas and last sections of the paper show some concrete characteristics and application example.

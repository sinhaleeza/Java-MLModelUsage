Metaheuristics grid (MHGrid) is a service oriented grid application that enables the user to solve almost any global optimization problem using metaheuristics techniques. Two problems potentially limit the generality of MHGrid over the problem type space; having a fixed set of solvers and lacking the solver-problem relation semantics. The set of strategies enforced to resolve these two problems are: offering the solvers as services, enabling the user to define his parallelization model, allowing the user to add his own service and maintaining service-based functionalities on both the middleware layer and application layer. This paper explains the design, architecture and implementation of the SOA that MHGrid endorses that would allow the enforcing of the resolving strategies.

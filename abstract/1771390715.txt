Because web services are loosely-coupled business applications, they are called to cooperate in distributed computing for the sake of efficiency. In this paper we propose a model formalizing web services efficiency considering different related parameters and a game-theoretical framework analyzing the web services strategies allowing them to maximize this efficiency. Many theoretical results are proved and confirmed through extensive simulations.

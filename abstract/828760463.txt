Dynamic service composition is suitable for on-demand business requests. For autonomic computing, service composition needs to deal with runtime environment faults, but also with business constraint violations which result from business requirements. We propose an approach for integrated handling of business constraint violations and runtime environment faults for dynamic service composition.We introduce a loosely coupled implementation architecture to maintain the platform independent nature.

The many conflicting technical, organizational, legal and domain-level constraints make the implementation of secure, inter-organizational workflows a very complex task, which is bound to low-level technical knowledge and error prone. The SECTINO project provides a framework for the realization and the high-level management of security-critical workflows based on the paradigm of model driven security. In our case the models are translated into runtime artefacts that configure a target reference architecture based on Web services technologies. In this paper we focus on the global workflow model, which captures the message exchange protocol between partners cooperating in a distributed environments well as basic security patterns. We show how the model maps to workflow and security components of the hosting environments at the partner nodes.

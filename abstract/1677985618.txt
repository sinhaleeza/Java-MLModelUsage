Designing E-Business applications in an efficient way has become a competitive necessity rather than a competitive advantage. One of the most important goals for many organizations is to satisfy their clients' service level agreements with respect to the response time and throughput. Adopting Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) during design and implementation promotes communication with the external and internal business entities. Web services are one of the popular technologies to achieve SOA solutions. Lookup web services are broadly used by many service consumers to fetch data which are used by their applications. In this paper we focus on how to efficiently build lookup web services using design patterns. Our goal is to improve the response time (latency) and throughput of lookup web services.

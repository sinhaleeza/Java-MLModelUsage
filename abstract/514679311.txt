Transactions are a fundamental technology for building efficient and reliable web service based applications. Various models and protocols have been developed by academic and industrial research community in order to effectively manage web services transactions. We propose a novel abstract model for dynamically modeling distinct web services transaction protocols. Model-based testing techniques can be used on the abstract model in order to automatically generate test scenarios.

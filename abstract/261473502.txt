Dynamic system adaptation to continuously changing business requirements and environment conditions has been a common demand for IT over the last years. In spite of constant innovation in service computing, current technology is not able to keep up with business ever growing need faster time to market. The Service Refinement Cycle (SRC) has been proposed for providing flexibility and power for creating new services by composing existing services with integrated policies. We developed and deployed a Service Execution Environment (SEE) for the SRC using existing technology, such as Web Services, XACML and WS-BPEL. As a proof of concept prototype, we also developed an Online Radio Service that makes extensive use of the key SRC features and is executed by our SEE.

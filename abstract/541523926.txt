The Internet of Things (IoT) involves numerous connected smart things with different technologies and communication standards. While IoT opens new opportunities in various fields, it introduces new challenges in the field of digital forensics investigations. The existing tools and procedures of digital forensics cannot meet the highly distributed and heterogeneous infrastructure of the IoT. Forensics investigators will face challenges while identifying necessary pieces of evidence from the IoT environment, and collecting and analyzing those evidence. In this article, we propose the first working definition of IoT forensics and systematically analyze the IoT forensics domain to explore the challenges and issues in this special branch of digital forensics. We propose a Forensics-aware IoT (FAIoT) model for supporting reliable forensics investigations in the IoT environment.

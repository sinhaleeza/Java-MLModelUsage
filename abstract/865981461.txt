Web services composition design, verification and monitoring are active and widely studied research directions. Little work however has been done in integrating these related dimensions using a unified formalism. In this paper we propose a declarative event-oriented framework, called DISC, that serves as a unified framework to bridge the gap between the process design, verification and monitoring. Proposed framework allows for a composition design to accommodate various aspects such as data relationships and constraints, Web services dynamic binding, compliance regulations, security or temporal requirements and others. Then, it allows for instantiating, verifying and executing the composition design and for monitoring the process while in execution. The effect of run-time violations can also be calculated and a set of recovery actions can be taken, allowing for the self-healing Web services composition.

In service-oriented mobile social networks (S-MSN), many location-based services are developed to provide various applications to social participants. Services can in turn be composed with the help of these participants. However, the composite structure, the subjective interpretation of trust demand, and the opportunistic connectivity make service composition a challenging task in S-MSN. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable trustworthy service evaluation and invocation during the process of composition. By analyzing dependency relationships, our approach can decentralizedly evaluate the trust degree of each service based on a lattice-based trust model to prevent data from being transmitted to untrustworthy counterparts. Besides, service consumers and vendors are able to specify their global and local constraints on the trust degree of service components on demand for more effective composition. Finally, by introducing acquaintances to the neighbors iteratively, social participants form a trust-aware acquaintance graph to forward invocation messages.

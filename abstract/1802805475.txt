In this paper we report on our work towards a novel system that aims at the combination of classical failure handling methods for composite service execution and support for automatic handling of semantic application level failures. In particular, we formulate the notion of Control Flow Intervention; a generalization for handling those two types of failure categories. When combined with automatic service composition it constitutes an optimistic forward recovery method. The method adopts expressive semantic service annotations provided by OWL resp. OWL-S.

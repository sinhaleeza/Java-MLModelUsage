The discovery of suitable web services for a given task from a brokerage system is the core part of current Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). With the number of registered web services growing, organization of search results is critical for improving the utility of any service search engine. A clustering view of search results is more effective than traditional ranked-list style in helping users to navigate into relevant services quickly and accurately. In this paper, we will propose an efficient clustering algorithm for organizing returned services. Our experiments validated the efficiency of the proposed method.

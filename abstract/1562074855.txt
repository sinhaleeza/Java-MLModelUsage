Many researchers have suggested fuzzy-based methods to derive rankings of services based on the fuzzy degree that each service satisfies a set of weighted quality attributes. Most of these methods assume a complete set of candidate services completely assessed. However, the candidate service set may include services which have not been fully assessed yet with respect to all quality attributes. Unassessed candidates introduce hesitation regarding the ranking of already evaluated services. This paper suggests Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs) to handle these sources of hesitation when assessing quality of services. IFS score functions are used to rank services with regard to each quality attribute. The final ranking can be derived by applying an objective method based on entropy weights for the quality attributes.

Today's information technologies, such as autonomic computing, offer companies new ways to do businesses. Those that fail to embrace and use such advantages in the next years are in danger to disappear or become zombie ones. In contrast, those pioneering these next-generation technology-business strategies will gain strategic advantage. This paper is about AWS-Net Traveler, which is an autonomic Web services framework for performing business processes in an autonomous mode. The main feature of this proposal is a decentralized architecture that heavily relies on peer-to-peer Web service brokers to coordinate, plan and perform Web service choreographies. We introduce the architecture of AWS-Net Traveler and the description of their main components.

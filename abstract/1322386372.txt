The key objective of OPUCE system is to enable the participation of end-users in the management of their own services, by providing them with innovative tools which allow an easy creation and delivery of personalized communication and information services. This paper describes the OPUCE service and component repository, which extends the OMA OSPE service model storage approach XDM. By integrating an ebXML registry using the native notification mechanisms of XDM, the search capability of the repository is dramatically improved. Moreover, this repository also exploits semantic Web technology to provide an intuitive visualized browser for convenient service exploring.

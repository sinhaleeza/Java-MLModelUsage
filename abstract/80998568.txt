With the proliferation of internet technologies, publish/subscribe systems have gained wide usage as a middleware. However for this model, catering large number of publishers and subscribers while retaining acceptable performance is still a challenge. Therefore, this paper presents two parallelization strategies to improve message delivery of such systems. Furthermore, we discuss other techniques which can be adopted to increase the performance of the middleware. Finally, we conclude with an empirical study, which establishes the comparative merit of those two parallelization strategies in contrast to serial implementations.

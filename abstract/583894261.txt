Digital asset management (DAM) has increasing benefits in booming global Internet economy, but it is still a great challenge for providing an effective way to manage, store, ingest, organize and retrieve digital asset. To do it, we present a new digital asset management platform, called DAM-Chain, with Transaction-based Access Control (TBAC) which integrates the distribution ABAC model and the blockchain technology. In this platform, the ABAC provides flexible and diverse authorization mechanisms for digital asset escrowed into blockchain while the blockchain's transactions serve as verifiable and traceable medium of access request procedure. We also present four types of transactions to describe the TBAC access control procedure, and provide the algorithms of these transactions corresponding to subject registration, object escrowing and publication, access request and grant. By maximizing the strengths of both ABAC and blockchain, this platform can support flexible and diverse permission management, as well as verifiable and transparent access authorization process in an open decentralized environment.

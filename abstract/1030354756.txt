In this paper we propose a meta-model for nonfunctional property descriptions targeted to support the selection of Web Services. The approach is based on the explicit distinction between NFP offered by providers and requested by users, on the concept of policy that aggregates NFP descriptions into single entities with an applicability condition, and finally on a set of constraint operators, which is particularly relevant for NFP requests. The semantic meta-model embracing the above perspective is defined by a BNF syntax whose semantics is formalized by an ontology. The ontology has been formalized in OWL-DL and WSML to provide for logical syntax. The logic upon which the meta-model supports NFP-based selection is discussed in the paper.

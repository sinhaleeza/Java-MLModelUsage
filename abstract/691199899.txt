New value-added business, generated by Web service composition in BPEL, provides more powerful and flexible features. SOAP-based web services invoked in BPEL are heavy with redundant information and lower performance. RESTful Web service is brought forward to new value-added business as an alternative solution. However, it's a big challenge to compose RESTful Web services with SOAP-based Web Services in SOA BPEL business processes. BPEL is not designed to use RESTful Web services because these types of services do not use WSDL to describe themselves. This paper proposes a novel approach for integrating RESTful Web services and SOAP-based Web services in business processes described in BPEL. The approach is applied to a practical multimedia conference BPEL process, and the experimental data show the stability of the new RESTful BPEL process with a higher performance.

Chinese enterprises have been conducting low-end processing for foreign brands. In recent years, they want to get rid of this high-pay low-income pattern and develop towards the high-end of the value chain. Most of them are transforming to service-focused enterprises that aim to provide customers with customized service. In service-focused enterprises, the human asset - like industry experts, technology experts, product experts and so on - is very important. Sometimes, the services provided by experts can directly affect the satisfaction of customers. Service-focused enterprises always have to face this challenge: multiple projects occur in emergency situations at the same time and need to dispatch multiple suitable experts from multiple places in order to respond. Under the constraint of human asset requirements on time and cost, this paper establishes an uncompromised resource allocation model for human asset emergency response. According to the characteristics of human asset emergency issues, the mathematical model can be presented to help solve the largescale emergency difficulties among multiple projects, multiple experts' types and multiple experts' locations. Finally, a case study is carried on to prove the algorithm's effectiveness.

In this paper, we study the communication over IP based on web services. We describe the service-oriented communication framework of WIP, Web Services Initiation Protocol, and focus on its web centric networking infrastructure. In our approach, WIP endpoints are exposed as resources on the Web, publishable by their UDDI service registries. They can be searched and discovered by regular web search engines, e.g. Google, upon which they can be networked and linked for scalable and distributed communication over IP. In our approach, the WIP endpoint is a web services based communication endpoint for communication over IP. It is also a service endpoint for software-as-a-service (SaaS) that can integrate, marshup, and enable advanced SaaS applications in communication. Moreover, we introduce the presence aware communication framework in WIP utilizing its extensible and service-oriented infrastructure. An advanced WIP communication system prototype has been implemented. It supports the advanced features described in this paper, including distributed communication, networking, security, presence, etc. Experimental results are presented, and the proposed approach and methods are validated.

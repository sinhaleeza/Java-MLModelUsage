This paper provides an artifact-pattern-matching framework and mathematical model to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the SOA solution design in model driven fashion and provide recommendations for optimal solution pattern enablement for solution artifacts. The artifact-pattern-matching system can be dynamically tuned based on the practitionerspsila final selections of there commendations. Specifically, we propose a set of solution patterns to guide SOA solution architects through the process of consuming and configuring SOA artifacts for composing SOA solutions. The resulting multi-dimensional cascading flagging method is also presented in this paper. As an example, impact analysis patterns are used as solution patterns to support traceability enablement. We present some future directions of leveraging reinforcement learning algorithms to enrich the design quality analytics of SOA solution.

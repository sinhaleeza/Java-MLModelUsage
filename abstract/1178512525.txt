This paper focuses on matching ontologies created for similar domains through different sources. Different solutions use lexical, structural or logical processing and analysis to match ontologies. However, an important aspect is also interpreting concepts that entities are presented with and using them in relation to semantics in an ontology. The paper demonstrates analyzing and extending the concepts used to define entities in an ontology, discusses establishing and filtering matching candidates by reasoners, and then describes constructing correspondences between entities from different ontologies using lexical and semantic analysis. The experiments show that our prototype, called OMI-DL, is among the top group over many ontologies adopted from the OAEI benchmark data set. We also provide an evaluation of the OMI-DL method for matching the DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology and the domain ontology developed in the m:Ciudad project.

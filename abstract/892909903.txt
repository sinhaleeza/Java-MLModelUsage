Scheduling is an important topic to support data security for workflow execution in clouds. Some workflow scheduling algorithms use security services such as authentication, integrity verification, and encryption for all workflow tasks. However, applying security services to no sensitive data does not make sense as no benefit is gained, yet it increases the makespan and monetary costs. In this paper, we introduce five policies for selection of tasks that handle sensitive data. We also propose a workflow scheduling algorithm based on a multi-populational genetic algorithm for minimizing cost while meeting a deadline. Experiments using four workflow applications show that our proposal can minimize both the makespan and cost, while maintaining the security of sensitive data compared to another approach in the literature.

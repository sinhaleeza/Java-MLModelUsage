The cost and time of deploying HPC applications on clouds is a problem. Instead of conducting their research discipline specialists are forced to carry out activities for application deployment, publication and ease of access. In response, a new approach for HPC application deployment and access in clouds is proposed. The major innovations are a new approach to deploying and executing HPC applications on IaaS and PaaS clouds, and exposing HPC applications as services. Through three case studies this paper demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach that could lead to the building of a SaaS library of discipline-oriented services evocable through user friendly, discipline specific interfaces. The new approach will reduce the time and money needed to deploy and expose discipline HPC applications.

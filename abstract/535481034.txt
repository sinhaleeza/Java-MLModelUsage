Monitoring resource utilization is an essential task in utility computing (UC). Typically, a UC manager with adaptors is used to orchestrate and collect the monitoring results. However, large IT systems, such as those in data centers are required to monitor dynamic resources running in distributed platforms, thus demanding a complex UC manager structure. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes a platform specific aspect-oriented programming (AOP) tool to dynamically weave a monitoring Web service into a running resource to enable communication with a UC manager exposed with standard monitoring Web service interfaces. This AO-Web service approach provides a simple yet powerful and effective means for the dynamic monitoring of distributed resources running in heterogeneous platforms.

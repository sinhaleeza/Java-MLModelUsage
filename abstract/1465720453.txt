The Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is becoming important and quite timing/space consuming due to the increasing volume of explosive data flood. During the past decades, there have been plenty of studies proposing software mechanisms to exploit the temporal locality in the IDS systems. However, it requires considerable memory blocks to store the redundancy table, therefore, the performance as well as the memory utilization is still worth pursuing. To tackle the above weakness, in this paper, we present xFilter, which explores the temporal locality to capture the redundancy, and propose a novel architecture to store and operate the redundancy table on FPGA. To demonstrate the performance of the xFilter structure, we designed a high efficient accelerator for Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm used in Snort to detect the attack strings. To show the performance of xFilter, we implement a hardware prototype using Xilinx Zynq FPGA platform. Experimental results show that the xFilter accelerator can achieve 5.1x speedup against software implementation with insignificant hardware cost. Furthermore, the proposed hardware redundancy table mechanism can achieve 1.6x speedup against the traditional hardware accelerator.

With the semantic Web and Web services we have potential technologies to develop architectures that support the broad integration of business processes. A growing number of standards like BPEL or WSCI enable us to develop integrated business process architectures on a corporate as well as on an industrywide level. Service-oriented architectures (SOA) permit us to develop new generations of integrated business applications from reusable components and along structures that represent mundane as well as sophisticated business processes. However, experiences in business process modeling show that developing Web services and the corresponding orchestration layer is quite challenging. The coexistence of semantic Web standards and natural language could help to lower the language barrier in design and orchestration, allowing even non-tech people to be involved in application design. Translating natural language descriptions into the semantics of the respective SOA can help to facilitate and fasten the design process.

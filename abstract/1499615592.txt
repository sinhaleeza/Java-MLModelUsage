Web Services standard-based system resource management is a new direction. In this paper, in order to verify the WS-Management standard whether to satisfy the realistic system resource management requirements, we use IBM MAPE categories to find more WS-Management related use cases. We design three typical use cases based on MAPE principles. Finally, we make a conclusion and propose our next-step work.

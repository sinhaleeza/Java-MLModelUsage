The mobile ambient is a formal model for mobile computation in which processes reside and move in a hierarchy of named locations organised as a tree-like structure, but the real-time property of the mobility has not been well described. In this paper, we extend mobile ambient with time, and then present discrete time mobile ambient calculus (DTMA). Based on DTMA, we investigate the modelling for Web service composition orchestration that has some mobility and time constraint. The service orchestration case which is used for the service composition example is formalized based on BPEL4WS basic actions modelling, and this work is a foundation for the model checking of the real-time mobile service orchestration.

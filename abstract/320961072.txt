Choreography changes performed by one party may affect other parties. The changes and the implication for other parties can be determined. However, the required changes on the orchestration are difficult to determine since a choreography is an abstraction of the orchestration and thus information is lost. In this paper an approach is proposed to enrich the orchestration with the observed changes using a syntactical representation of the orchestration language and semantic invariants of the orchestration language.

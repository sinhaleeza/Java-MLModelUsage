Nowadays, faced with heterogeneous, isolated content service systems, people require peering or allied content services. Firstly, we analyze some existing content service hybrid schemes, such as CDN over P2P Architecture and Peering of CDN Architecture. Based on problem statement, we propose A Novel Web Services-based Content Delivery Service Peering Scheme (WS-CDSP), and we describe scheme architecture design, which support multiple-to-multiple loosely-coupled peering services through Web Service Information Endpoint and Web Service Management Endpoint. And then we focus on main system function design, Web Service Information Endpoint and Web Service Management Endpoint design mechanism. After that, We discuss CDN or VoD composite resource model based on CIM. As part of experiment work, we discuss WS-CDSP scheme implementation and comparative experiment, and then analyze the experiment results. At last, from our research experiences and related survey, we analyze the prospective research direction and challenges in this field.

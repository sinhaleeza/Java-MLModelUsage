In to days economy, collaborative computing grows in importance. Inter-organizational service-based processes are increasingly adopted by different companies when they cannot achieve goals on their own. As a result, conformance problems arise and it must be ensured that the integrity of processes execution remains guaranteed. In this paper, we propose new components, to be deployed along the boundaries of each participating organization, offering external flow control, and notification in case of violation detection, while providing process execution traceability. To achieve our goals, we propose an event-based approach in which inter-organizational exchanges are perceived as events. We define event patterns for filtering the desirable incoming and outgoing messages.

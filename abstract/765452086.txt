Customer contact centers have to regularly and proactively evaluate and adapt their customer handling processes to support the business vision of their clients and to maintain a competitive differentiating edge. This work presents the contact collector tool developed at IBM that allows the contact center supervisors to record and analyze the behavior of various agent customer handling processes. The contact collector tool generates quantifiable insights to improve operational strengths and productivity as well as to enhance the quality of the overall interaction. The present work also discusses the advantages of automating the contact collector tool, technical challenges encountered in the automation process so far and performance of the automated components of the tool.

The ultimate target of business to business (B2B) integration and deployment is complete business process automation within and between enterprises with no human intervention. From a business point of view, negotiation is the main mechanism that modern enterprises use to achieve targets that maximise their profits. This paper proposes an automated B2B negotiation solution: the implementation of semantic-enabled machine versus machine business negotiation as a Web service. We argue that the shift from human vs. human to machine vs. machine business negotiation is facilitated by using semantic Web technology implemented with Web services. The negotiation process in this work is designed for multiple machines (a minimum of 3 computers), using a negotiation algorithm that emulates the behaviour of human business negotiations. Possible development directions are brought forward in the paper's conclusion.

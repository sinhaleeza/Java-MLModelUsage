Driven by the emergence of new computing environments, dynamically evolving software systems makes it impossible for developers to deploy software with human-centric processes. Instead, there is an increasing need for automation tools that continuously deploy software into execution, in order to push updates or adapt existing software regarding contextual and business changes. Existing solutions fall short on providing fault-tolerant, reproducible deployments that can scale on heterogeneous environments. In this paper we present Rondo, a tool suite that enables continuous deployment for dynamic, service-oriented applications. At the center of these tools, we propose a deterministic and idem potent deployment process. We provide with Rondo a deployment manager that implements this process and capable of conducting deployments and continuously adapting applications according to the changes in the current target platform. The tool suite also includes a domain-specific language for describing deployment requests. We validate our approach in multiple projects, for provisioning the platform as well as for installing applications and continuous reconfigurations.

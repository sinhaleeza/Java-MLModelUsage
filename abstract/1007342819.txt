When using SOAs in mission critical environments, quality and performance related aspects may not be ignored. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) have to be defined and applied during runtime. In this paper we present a method to enhance an existing SOA container to take into account Quality of Service (QoS) related aspects and enforce these aspects during runtime using feedback controlled priority adaptations. Without major modifications existing business services can use this QoS-component. A use case of the Luxembourg National Benefits Fund shows the benefits of the proposed solution in an operational system.

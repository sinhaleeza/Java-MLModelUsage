We describe a framework for personalized context aware search of ontology-based tagged data. As more services are offered on the Web, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to manage their content online. We propose a framework that performs context-aware search of tagged data using a tag ontology that includes context information in addition to tagged keywords in order to present more meaningful search results to users.

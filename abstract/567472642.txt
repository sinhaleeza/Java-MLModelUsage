In environments with limited network bandwidth, current web service execution mode will face challenges for its enormous demand for network bandwidth. The transmitted message which contains real payload and XML-based format data seems to be verbose. The response time and fail risk will be brought to increase as well. In this paper we address this issue and propose an agent-based compression method. A software agent is deployed between the requesters and invokers to execute services and return results to the requesters. The transmitted messages size is reduced by stripping off redundant data and adaptive data compression. We conduct a detailed evaluation of compression effectiveness and provide the results of execution time measurements. The effectiveness of the approach is proved by the experiment results and the conclusion is given.

This paper describes our latest work on designing and developing a benchmarking system to be applied to AMS (Application Management Service) domain. Benchmarking allows an AMS client or account to understand where it stands in relative to others in terms of its operational performance, and helps it set a realistic target to reach. We elaborate the entire system process in the paper which consists of the following modules: account data collection, cleansing, sampling, mapping and normalization, benchmarking pool formation, KPI (key performance indicator) design for account performance measurement, KPI implementation, evaluation and visualization, and finally, a post-benchmarking analysis. So far, we have applied this benchmarking tool to a dozen of real AMS accounts, and have received some initial yet encouraging feedback.

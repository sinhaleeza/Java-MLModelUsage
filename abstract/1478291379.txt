Personal Mobility Profiles of cellphone users play a crucial role in a wide range of context-aware applications. Transportation mode, a representative feature of users' mobility, can provide much richer context information to the pervasive computing applications. This paper presents a data driven classification model to detect transportation mode from sparse GPS trajectory data. The contributions of this paper lie in the following two aspects. On one hand, we propose a transportation mode classification model based on a deep architecture formed by an SAE model to further improve the inference performance. On the other hand, the relevant features related to the underlying transportation network information are redefined and considered to improve the final classification efficiency and effectiveness. Five representative travel modes-walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a subway, and driving-are distinguished. Four different models including Bayesian Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are compared with our model and tested with the GPS trajectory data in Beijing. As a result, we achieved the average precision and recall accuracy being greater than other models, which are 93.58% and 93.32%, respectively.

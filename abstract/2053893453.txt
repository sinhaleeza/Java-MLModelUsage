A model of a knowledge intensive service system is introduced to study knowledge sharing in these systems. Simulation experiments based on the model are conducted to relate particular aspects of knowledge creation and sharing to a metric of service performance. The results indicate that certain network configurations of knowledge sharing among the service provider agents have performance advantages over others. In addition, the degree of fallibility associated with shared knowledge has a significant impact on performance. This paper is part of a research program that investigates the knowledge dynamics within service systems with particular focus on the influence of human, social and structural factors.

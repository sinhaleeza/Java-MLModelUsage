Two practical paradigms are presented, which facilitate domain concepts to be directly used to model business operations: the first paradigm is based on the business artifacts and their life cycle; the second paradigm is based on the business tasks and their sequencing. Transformation is an effective way to bridge the gap between business level analysis and IT solutions. We present algorithms that transform business process models based on these two paradigms into IT solutions of Web service platform. The specific problems we addressed in this transformation are: 1) how to generate the implementation code of an optimal size; 2) how to preserve the natural structure of business process models in the generated code.

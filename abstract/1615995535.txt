A key challenge posed by the Internet of Services is that applications need to cope with a continuously changing environment, both in terms of the context in which they operate and of the services, users and providers involved. Differently from applications where traditional change detection and adaptation mechanisms can be used, the Internet of Services requires systems that are adaptive by design. In this paper we present a design for adaptation framework supporting the modeling, development and operation of service based applications operating in highly dynamic environments. The approach exploits advanced techniques for dynamic and incremental service composition, allowing to effectively deal with changes occurring at different levels in the system. An implementation of the proposed solution is presented and evaluated on a real-world scenario from the Smart Urban Mobility domain.

Navdriver is a freely-available Software-as-a-Service technology that leverages hotlink assignment algorithms. This paper provides a formal description of the hotlink assignment problem, as originally described over a decade ago, as well as its representation inside Navdriver. This paper reconciles the description of Navdriver found in [1] with the mathematical statement of the hotlink assignment problem used in [2]. Furthermore, this paper describes, for the first time, details of the Navdriver algorithms that had not been disclosed before. The paper also discusses the applicability of Navdriver in real websites as well as limitations, in general, of inserting hotlinks dynamically in production websites.

Dynamic and flexible service composition and interactionare a must in service oriented computing (SOC) scenarios. In this paper the authors present an extension to a previous work, the DENEB platform for the development and execution of Web processes, allowing Web processes to acquire and execute new interaction protocols at runtime. This makes DENEB a well adapted and flexible platform for service integration, useful to work in complex and evolving inter-organisational environments. The proposed solution is exemplified by means of the development of a real use case.

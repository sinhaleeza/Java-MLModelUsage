The paper presents a taxonomy of notions of consistency in the context of dynamic migration of business processes covering two decades of research on dynamic process change in various workflow approaches including graph based and net based approaches. A consolidated view that brings out the generic nature of the consistency problem independent of the respective workflow model contexts is developed through the taxonomy framework. The consistency models are unified based on a common Petri net formalism. The classification into nine major consistency classes is derived primarily from differences arising out of the past, present and future of the post migration state. These are further grouped into four categories: structure based, trail based, lookahead trace based and live consistency models. Known usages of these models from the literature are also discussed. Moreover, several examples of dynamic workflow migration scenarios are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the consistency models.

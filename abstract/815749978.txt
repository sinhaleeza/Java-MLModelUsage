The performance of service system is especially low when demand is stochastic and nonstationary. This paper considers an inventory control problem with multiple-period replenishment lead time and nonstationary stochastic demand, and provides an optimal policy for this kind of problem. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming model, then a solution algorithm which can obtain the optimal solution is developed. Numerical comparisons verify the effectiveness of the proposed policy.

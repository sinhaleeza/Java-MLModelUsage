Service-Oriented Computing is benefit of interoperation among services. Current service-oriented computing research is much more concerning the low level interoperation among services, such as service discovery, service composition etc. However, the high level research issue-the feature interaction problem is also challenging the interoperation of service-oriented computing. Traditional feature interaction methods are focused on the service design phrase with formal methods or software engineering analysis. Autonomy and distribution of service deploying style have made the needs of runtime detecting and resolving feature interaction in SOC research community. This paper investigates the detection of feature interactions in web services at runtime and proposes ESTRIPs, an extended STRIPS operation conflict-free of services in business process detection method, which reasons from OWL-S and SWRL combined with runtime SOAP messages. First, we give the model of the feature interaction problem in business process during its execution and then the ESTRIPS method given in detail. The implementation of a prototype is illustrated. Using a real world scenario shows the plausibility of our method of detecting feature interactions of business process.

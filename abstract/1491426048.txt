With the popularity of cloud computing, many cloud service providers deploy regional data centers to offer services and pplications. These large-scale data centers have drawn extensive attention in terms of the huge energy demand and carbon emission. Thus, how to make use of their spatial diversities to green data centers and reduce cloud provider's costs is an important concern. In this paper, we integrate service reward, electricity cost, carbon taxes and service performance to study cost-effective request scheduling for cloud data centers. We propose an online and distributed scheduling algorithm CESA to chieve the flexible tradeoff between these conflicting objectives. The time complexity of CESA is polynomial, and it can be implemented in a parallel way. CESA requires no prior knowledge of the statistics of request arrivals or future electricity prices, yet it provably approximates the optimal system profit while bounding the queue length. Real-trace based simulations are conducted which verify the effectiveness of our CESA algorithm.

Kitchen safety is a highly important concern for daily living activities. Cooking, usually, is accompanied with several risks particularly for elderly people, due to aging associated impairments. Therefore, cooking-safe environment is required to enhance safety. In this paper, we present our cooking-safe smart oven system which manages the detection of risk situations and determines their severity levels according to the contextual information around oven. The context is gathered via sensors deployed in the kitchen environment. The cooking-safe system is composed of sensor nodes, actuators, microcontroller, and a computing unit. Cooking related risks are managed by the fuzzy logic based reasoning engine of the cooking-safe system. We also present in details our risk prevention algorithms which constitute the basic concepts of the reasoning engine. We discuss the system evaluation in real-world environment, and the interventions via interactive interfaces with users.

By employing Web services technology, the grid system is evolving to be more manageable service infrastructure, including lifetime management, discovery of characteristics, and notifications. Reliable messaging is one of the key issues addressed for quality of services in Web services. In this paper, we propose a reliable message scheme designed for mobile environments in the context of a Web services architecture; Web services-Wireless Reliable Messaging (WS-WRM). We also consider the federation issues with emerging specifications proposed by leading Web services standard groups. We eventually intend to extend the reliability to mobile end-nodes in a more efficient way. In this paper, we address the design issues and describe the detailed scheme of messaging architecture.

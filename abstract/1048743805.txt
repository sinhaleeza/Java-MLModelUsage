The availability of large volumes of Semantic Web data has created the potential of discovering vast amounts of knowledge. Semantic relation discovery is a fundamental technology in analytical domains, such as business intelligence and homeland security. Because of the decentralized and distributed nature of Semantic Web development, semantic data tend to be created and stored independently in different organizations. Under such circumstances, discovering semantic relations faces numerous challenges, such as isolation, scalability, and heterogeneity. This paper proposes an effective strategy to discover semantic relationships over large-scale distributed networks based on a novel hierarchical knowledge abstraction and an efficient discovery protocol. The approach will effectively facilitate the realization of the full potential of harnessing the collective power and utilization of the knowledge scattered over the Internet.

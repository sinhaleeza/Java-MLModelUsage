In today's world, social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat, and Reddit are an integral part of youth and kids.

It has been a growing concern for parents and government as it has steadily increased the mortality rates of youth and kids. Given the degree of freedom one can have on the internet, it's a pain to prevent cyberbullying efficiently.

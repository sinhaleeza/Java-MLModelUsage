Faced with the increasing services and users' personalized requirements, it remains a big challenge for users to effectively and accurately discover and reuse interested services. Goal oriented requirements modeling has attracted more and more attentions in services discovery and modeling, but little work has focused on extracting intentional goals from service descriptions. In this paper, based on the ranked domain keywords, we investigate how to extract domain-specific service goals from service descriptions, which can contribute to services discovery and recommendation. Programmable Web, a publicly accessible service repository, is selected as the testbed. Experiments show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

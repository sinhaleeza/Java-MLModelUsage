To realize human-centered coordinating services in ubiquitous computing, we require a framework that coordinates physically distributed heterogeneous services according to users' intentions and locations. How can we coordinate the services to assist the user in receiving a coordinated service to maximize the user's satisfaction in an environment? In order to solve this issue, we have been developing a sort of agent-based coordination framework, called "location-mediated Web service coordination," that orchestrates Web services wrapped in the agents. In this paper, we show a prototype application of the framework, context-aware information assist services in a museum.

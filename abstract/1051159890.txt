Web services are very prevalent nowadays. Recommending Web services that users are interested in becomes an interesting and challenging research problem. In this paper, we present AWSR (Active Web Service Recommendation), an effective Web service recommendation system based on users' usage history to actively recommend Web services to users. AWSR extracts user's functional interests and QoS preferences from his/her usage history. Similarity between user's functional interests and a candidate Web service is calculated first. A hybrid new metric of similarity is developed to combine functional similarity measurement and nonfunctional similarity measurement based on comprehensive QoS of Web services. The AWSR ranks publicly available Web services based on values of the hybrid metric of similarity, so that a Top-K Web service recommendation list is created for a user. AWSR has been implemented and deployed on the Web. By conducting large-scale experiments based on a real-world Web services dataset, it is shown that our system effectively recommends Web services based on users functional interests and non-functional requirements with excellent performance.

We propose a skyline computation approach that enables service users to optimally access sets of services as an integrated service package. We first present a one pass algorithm based on the observation that a multi-service skyline is completely determined by single service skylines. The skyline is returned after an enumeration on a significantly reduced candidate space. We then develop a dual progressive algorithm that is able to progressively report the skyline. We conduct an experimental study to assess the performance of the skyline computation approaches.

Web services are now widely used in web-based applications. To protect the information in web services, many security specifications have been proposed. Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) provides us a brand new cryptographic primitive for access control. This paper sets out to examine an unexplored area to date - how attribute-based encryption might be used to provide privacy and security for web services. We try to implement ABE in web services. The implementation and performance evaluation demonstrate that ABE is efficient and feasible in web services.

The growing need for an integrated view of scientific information from different sources has led to the need for scientific information integration, and on the other hand, SOA is one most prevailing technology for its advantages on solving integration problems. In this paper, we argue that the deployment of SOA in an organization should be business domain-specific, and propose an approach called CAFISE-S, which introduces SOA into scientific information integration from a business view-aspect. Business service is put forward as basic elements in CAFISE-S to model business context and IT services coherently in a semantic way. Based on business service, CAFISE-S provides a business domain-specific modeling method for specification of information services, and then supports business-oriented publication, management and usage of information services. The implementation of CAFISE-S platform and an application of CAFISE-S in a real-world project of scientific information integration are also presented in this paper.

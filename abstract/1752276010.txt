One of the main challenges that encounter Web services is how to ensure reliable compositions. In this paper we present an approach that starts from a composite service effective executions to improve its reliability. Basically, we propose a set of mining techniques to discover its model and its transactional behavior from an event based log. Then, based on this mining step, we use a set of rules to improve its recovery mechanisms

Service composition remains an important topic where recommendation is widely recognized as a core mechanism. Existing works on service recommendation typically examine either association rules from mashup-service usage records, or latent topics from service descriptions. This paper moves one step further, by studying latent topic models over service collaboration history. A concept of service co-occurrence topic is coined, equipped with a mechanism developed to construct service co-occurrence documents. The key idea is to treat each service as a document and its co-occurring services as the bag of words in that document. Four gauges are constructed to measure self-co-occurrence of a specific service. A theoretical approach, Service Co-occurrence LDA (SeCo-LDA), is developed to extract latent service co-occurrence topics, including representative services and words, temporal strength, and services' impact on topics. Such derived knowledge of topics will help to reveal the trend of service composition, understand collaboration behaviors among services and lead to better service recommendation. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, experiments on a real-world data set were conducted. Compared with methods of Apriori, content matching based on service description, and LDA using mashup-service usage records, our experiments show that SeCo-LDA can recommend service composition more effectively, i.e., 5% better in terms of Mean Average Precision than baselines.

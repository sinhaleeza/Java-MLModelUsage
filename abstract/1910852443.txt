This paper presents COLQUIDE an environment for building WEB portals out of existing autonomous and distributed services accessible through Internet. The system provides tools for selecting services with specific functional requirements and for specifying the way their execution must be synchronized within a portal. A portal is a n-tier information system accessible through the WEB, that synchronises transparently the execution (data exchange and communication) of services with user interaction and thereby implements a value added service.

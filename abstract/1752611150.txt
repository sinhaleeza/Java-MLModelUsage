Current frameworks to track the Quality of Services (QoS) are strictly related to the traditional IT approach and they are not suitable to ensure a proper control on Cloud Computing environments. This paper firstly discusses the differences of a cloud SLM versus traditional SLMs and summarizes emerging challenges in service discovery, selection and management process of SLM in cloud. Secondly it overviews the current state of business and academy by a survey and a literature review. Finally it introduces a third party SLM framework for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Cloud Service Consumers (CSCs). This framework, which aims at an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-use approach, called SLM as a Service, was tested in a real case. Results show that a third party SLM is equal, dependable and reasonably easy to implement.

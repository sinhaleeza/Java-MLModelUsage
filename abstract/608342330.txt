The aim of this paper is to reveal some intrinsic disadvantages of the current version of UDDI standard, which create problems in using it as a standard for private, in-house storage of enterprise services. Examples include: access control mechanisms in UDDI, limited rich queries capability, inappropriate mapping of Web service artifacts into UDDI entities, impossibility of managing classification system values, etc. For each disadvantage we consider, we give an illustrative example of its impact in an enterprise service environment. To overcome these disadvantages, some service registry implementations, based on UDDI introduce proprietary extensions to the standard, or embed additional programmatic logic in their client modules of UDDI, which decreases interoperability between them.

Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has recently gained momentum among network operators as a means to share their physical infrastructure among virtual operators, which can independently compose and configure their communication services. However, the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic demands and computational loads can result in high congestion and low network performance for virtual operators, thus leading to service level agreement breaches. In this paper, we analyze the congestion resulting from the sharing of the physical infrastructure and propose innovative orchestration mechanisms based on both centralized and distributed approaches, aimed at unleashing the potential of the NFV technology. In particular, we first formulate the network functions composition problem as a non-linear optimization model to accurately capture the congestion of physical resources. To further simplify the network management, we also propose a dynamic pricing strategy of network resources, proving that the resulting system achieves a stable equilibrium in a completely distributed fashion, even when all virtual operators independently select their best network configuration. Numerical results show that the proposed approaches consistently reduce resource congestion. Furthermore, the distributed solution well approaches the performance that can be achieved using a centralized network orchestration system.

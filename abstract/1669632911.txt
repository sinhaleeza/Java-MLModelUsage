Nowadays web users have clearly expressed their wishes to receive and interact with personalized services directly. However, existing approaches, largely syntactic content-based, fail to provide robust, accurate and useful personalized services to its users. Towards such an issue, the semantic web provides technologies to annotate and match services' descriptions with users' features, interests and preferences, thus allowing for more efficient access to services and more generally information. The aim of our work, part of service personalization, is on automated instantiation of services which is crucial for advanced usability i.e., how to prepare and present services ready to be executed while limiting useless interactions with users? To this end, we exploit Description Logics reasoning through semantic matching to (i) identify useful parts of a user profile that satisfy services requirements (i.e., input parameters) and (ii) compute the description required by a service to be executed but not provided by the user profile. Our approach, part of the EC-funded project SOA4All, was evaluated on its applicability in real world scenarios with end-users.

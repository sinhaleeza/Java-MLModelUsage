IP multicast has not been deployed because of hardware problems. So a new scheme called end system multicast or overlay multicast for group communication has been emerged. It supports IP multicast functions, which is located on application level. For developing it, we have been focused on efficient overlay tree construction among group members with low stretch and stress. However, we should consider a variety of transmission or receipt condition since a real Internet environment has users with various transmission/receipt rates. Thus, we make on-demand one-time source specific tree depending on required bandwidth information of group members when a member requests data transmission. Our mechanism provides satisfied data quality limited maximum transmission rate of the source to each group members. Furthermore, we manage a large group enough as distributing control information to cores that are designated members for maintaining host member information. Lastly, we prove that our tree guarantees data quality to each group members, and show low tree construction time is required. In addition, for evaluating group scalability, we analyze control information increasing rate via group size, and validate its scalability.

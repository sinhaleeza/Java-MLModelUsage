Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and hardware and system software in the cloud server farm that provides those services. The research on server backup of cloud server farm appears to be an important issue of cloud computing economics. Optimal logistic policy should be considered to be a profit-oriented framework simultaneously for providing qualified service to cloud users while the whole cloud center is under construction. The kernel point of the proposed approach is that a novel design pattern is developed for approaching optimal profit on logistics using the finite-source queuing theory. To model the proposed approach for qualitative analysis, a Petri Net model was developed to configure all relevant system aspects in a concise fashion. On quantitative work, a comprehensive mathematical analysis on profit pattern has been made in detail. Relevant simulations have also been conducted tovalidate the proposed optimization model. The design illustration is presented to demonstrate engineering application scenario in cloud environment, hence the proposed approach indeed provides a feasibly profit-oriented framework to meet logistic economy.

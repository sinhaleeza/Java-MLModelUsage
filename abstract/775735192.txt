In recent years, REST (Representational State Transfer) has received much attention for designing scalable web services in various domains. There is an increasing interest on its application to real-time communication web services. Based on a case study of CSTA services, we found that communication services exhibit a combination of complex message exchange and stateful behavior patterns, including multi-states, two-way interaction, event-driven, multi-resources, multi-responses and session management, that need to be modeled properly within the framework of REST. To address these challenges, we propose three REST design patterns: session, event subscription and relationship using REST composition. This approach leads to a systematic one-to-one transformation from CSTA to REST. We hope such a study on a concrete use case can contribute to a better understanding of REST and lead to a seamless convergence of communication services with the infrastructure of the Web.

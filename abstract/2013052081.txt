This paper presents a novel monitoring architecture addressed to the cloud provider and the cloud consumers. This architecture offers a monitoring platform-as-a-Service to each cloud consumer that allows to customize the monitoring metrics. The cloud provider sees a complete overview of the infrastructure whereas the cloud consumer sees automatically her cloud resources and can define other resources or services to be monitored. This is accomplished by means of an adaptive distributed monitoring architecture automatically deployed in the cloud infrastructure. This architecture has been implemented and released under GPL license to the community as “MonPaaS”, open source software for integrating Nagios and OpenStack. An intensive empirical evaluation of performance and scalability have been done using a real deployment of a cloud computing infrastructure in which more than 3,700 VMs have been executed.

We have developed an application service hosting middleware for enterprise information systems, "Polimatica", upon which a policy-customizable private virtual organization (pVO) is built. The pVO is a collection of customizable application services in the global grid computing environment. "Polimatica" is distinctive in terms of abstraction capabilities in (1) policy instance description, (2) view synthesis of an extensive resource data model, (3) operation aggregation on the OGSI extension interfaces. The performance to enforce the policy instances is measured in a laboratory testbed for an enterprise ASP, providing B2B e-commerce (BizEngine/WS) and interactive media communication service (LiveComm). We have verified that, in 60 seconds, the feedback loop in a pVO adjusts the application services as customized given the changing environment.

Resource Virtualization is one of major capabilities in cloud. Computing and Storage virtualization is widely used in cloud. Networking virtualization becomes a trend of cloud computing. In past, user can only request a networking resource offline, virtual network can be allocation as needed. Allocating the network on demand will become a challenge for network. In this work in progress study, we propose an Enhanced KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm for Virtual Network Allocation in cloud (EKMPC), which use the concept of KMP.

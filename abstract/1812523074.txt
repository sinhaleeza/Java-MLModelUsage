The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of Web services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health) leading to the need to protect the personal privacy of Web service users.

Developers would benefit by being able to incrementally measure and modify their services during development until certain target levels of privacy protection are reached. This paper presents an approach for measuring how well a Web service protects personal privacy and illustrates the approach with an example

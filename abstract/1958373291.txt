A Web service specification can be quite complex, including multiple operations and various kinds of message exchange patterns. In this work, we focus on the problem of restructuring a Web service, which contains a process model inside, preserving at the same time its behavior that is shown to the service user. We provide a behavioral signature model for service restructuring. It is considered for Web services to be choreography equivalence if they conform to the same behavioral signature model. Based on behavioral signature models and graph searching technologies, we provide an algorithm for restructuring the process model from within the service while assuring service choreography equivalence. A case study runs throughout the paper to illustrate the feasibility of our work. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate and evaluate our approach.

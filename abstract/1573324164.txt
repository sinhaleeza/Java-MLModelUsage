The Web service paradigm promotes the delivery of software as a service via the Web, instead of a product to end-users. The increase in assigned responsibilities for supporting organizational operations drives the needs for higher operational efficiencies (i.e. performance and reliability) and flexibilities (i.e. customizations). This paper makes two contributions. An infrastructure to support the development and operation of customized cost model components, used to manage cost efficiency and reliability issues. Secondly, a generic cost model algorithm that can be used as the foundation algorithm for cost model components. Further, the process of Web service relocation is also demonstrated and implementation has also been discussed.

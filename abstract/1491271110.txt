In this paper we introduce a Web service promotion model - Web services community. This service community supports three types of IT resource management networks - participant network, service network, and resource network. We then analyze a quality of service model for a set-vice request from multi-perspectives for the purpose of evaluating the service fulfillment. Finally an optimization approach based on the three types of networks is developed for optimizing the service fulfillment in this service community.

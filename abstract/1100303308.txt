Pervasive Information System (PIS) represents a new generation of Information Systems (IS) available anytime, anywhere in a pervasive environment. In this paper, we propose to enhance PIS transparency and efficiency through a context-aware intentional service prediction approach. This approach allows anticipating user's future needs, offering and recommending him the most suitable service in a transparent and discrete way. We detail in this paper our service prediction mechanism and present encouraging experimental results demonstrating our proposition.

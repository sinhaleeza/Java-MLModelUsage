Rapid evaluation and treatment of time-dependent diseases such as acute stroke need fast and consistent communication between medical service providers. Our framework accepts data from hospital systems and medical evaluations, and composes it into new forms to suit different recipients and mobile devices. We have implemented a prototype application for stroke therapy which reduces the time from patient arrival to CT scan by 43%, and the time from arrival to treatment by 48% respectively. Our system can perform context-based CT image retrieval and allows images to be reviewed on mobile devices. Context-based QoS adaptation has been shown to reduce the transmission time required to transmit 619 brain images to mobile devices from 1336 seconds to 106 seconds. The system utilizes medical information standards, including DICOM and HL7.

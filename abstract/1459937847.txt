The programming model of the current distributed systems such as middleware CORBA or JAVA RMI is based on remote procedure call. Without the support of high-level API for coordination, developing real-world distributed grid applications in this model is difficult. We present an algorithm for multiparty interaction, a key abstraction of distributed coordination for the future distributed grid programming.

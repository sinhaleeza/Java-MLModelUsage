With the development of Service-Oriented Technologies, the amount of Web services grows rapidly. Situation awareness, as a very important computing paradigm which can provide more reasonable and complete representation of the user's environment, can be benefit to the discovering of the service user's requirement. Therefore in this paper, we explore to use the situational information to recommend services which satisfy the requirement of users better and meanwhile improve the QoS prediction accuracy. Both the convergences between users' service selections in different situations and their QoS experiences have been taken into account. Moreover, we investigate the potential relationships between the situations structure and the services selection. Experiment results indicate that our method achieves ideal performance.

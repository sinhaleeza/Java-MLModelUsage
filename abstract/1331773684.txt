The Service Oriented Computing Paradigm proposes the construction of applications by integrating preexistent services. In recent times, automated business processes and web services have become ubiquitous. In this paper, we propose the automation of service composition that takes the abstract specification of a composition and the definition of concrete services. We make a reduction from this rewriting problem to exact cover problem, represented by a bipartite graph. We present a program analysis and experimental results to show the efficiency of our proposed mechanism.

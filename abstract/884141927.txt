Automated web service composition has been tackled from different directions and to different purposes. In addition, most of the approaches address the composition problem with under specified requirements, returning compositions models that do not necessarily satisfy and fulfill end-users objectives. Satisfying the latter objectives is a difficult problem, especially from scratch, which requires stronger requirements and a further step of integration with service-based components in order to make service oriented computing and service composition a reality. In this work, we address this issue by presenting an innovative and integrated approach to service composition which consists of i) an automatic template process generator, that is able to generate abstract process templates and their hierarchy from past executions; ii) a novel and scalable approach to AI parametric-design techniques using a multi agent approach to configure and adapt services processes, heavily relying on the latter set of abstract process templates; iii) an optimization process that maximizes the overall quality of final compositions. Finally, we compare the scalability of these components with some experiments.

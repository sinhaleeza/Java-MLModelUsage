In this paper, we propose an approach for the verification of declarative Web services composition processes using satisfiability solving. The need for the satisfiability solving approach stems from the nature of declarative processes which are defined by only specifying the constraints that mark the boundary of the solution to the composition process. As a result the state space of a declarative process can be significantly large, as the process is only partially defined and all the transitions have not been explicitly defined. Further, as the conflict clauses returned by the SAT solver can be significantly large for complex processes and verification requirements, we propose a filtering criteria and defined patterns for identifying the clauses of interest for process verification.

This paper presents an event based functionality integration framework to approach the issue of service personalization and service mashups. In contrast to existing data integration approaches, the proposed framework addresses the mashup issue from a new perspective by extracting and reasoning the context through user generated event, while recommending and aggregating the contextual services dynamically in response to the user's functional requirements. An event hierarchy is proposed to retrieve contextual information and analyze underlying functionalities. The three layer system framework, service recommendation logic, and the functionality integration are also presented.

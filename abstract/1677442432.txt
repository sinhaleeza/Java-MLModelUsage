With the success of the network convergence, we have no more difficulty to transport most of contents and deliver any service. However, nowadays' users desire to have his own services with a richer media as the content. As a result, it challenges to reconsider a new service paradigm and its delivery. Driven by the trend of different mobility and service ubiquity, the service convergence comes into sight as a promising solution facing the NGS context. Moreover, reengineering is needed for the delivery of the converged services. Existing solutions as IN, SOA and WS have not been able to completely cover all the converged service delivery needs. This paper proposes to redesign the service by modelling its structure and converged interfaces. We proposed a loose coupling between service elements (service composition) as well as a more flexible deployment of services (service aggregation) in order to meet converged service delivery.

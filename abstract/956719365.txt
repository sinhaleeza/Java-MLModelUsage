Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that users can request on-demand computing services through networks and cloud computing platforms anytime and anywhere. Some distinguishing characteristics of cloud computing are elasticity, scalability, hardware virtualization, fast service configuration, etc. In cloud computing environments, three kinds of services can be provided, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). These cloud services can be composed into a value-added service to satisfy the dynamic needs of Internet users. This paper proposes a self-healing framework for service composition in cloud environments.

This paper describes an e-business solution model designed in Wachovia Corporation, one of the top largest banks in USA, serving millions of customers with a variety of financial services such as online banking, billpay and brokerage. A pragmatic process is designed to migrate conventional n-tier ecommerce systems to a service-oriented computing paradigm, which comprises service-oriented architecture (SOA), integration (SOI), process (SOP) and management (SOM). A hybrid methodology is developed to leverage the benefits of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. E-business patterns are applied to categorize various online services, which are subsequently mapped to appropriate technologies, products/tools, and infrastructure. Common business functionalities are built as shared services to be reused across channels. A multilayer model is conceived to converge the latest technologies such as portal, process orchestration, Web services, service bus, grid computing, business rules, etc. Best practices as well as lessons learned are discussed in the context.

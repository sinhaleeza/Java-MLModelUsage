Web service evaluation is a phase of the Web service selection in which discovered Web services are evaluated with respect to user request, which means that the non functional properties (NFPs) offered by Web services are compared with the non functional properties requested by users. The fact that users and providers can express their NFPs in very flexible ways makes the management of NFPs a very complex task. In this paper we propose a computing-oriented description of NFPs and a novel approach to NFP-based service evaluation based on Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming. This proposal extends our previous work on Policy Centered Meta-model (PCM).

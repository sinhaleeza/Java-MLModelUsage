Network Centric Information Infrastructure (NCII) is a toolkit of prefabricated software components together with a composition framework for integration and experimentation. Typical distributed system applications of a toolkit such as NCH can be applied to air traffic management, shop floor control and in-flight connection to Internet. The composition framework has gone though through three generations of changes in the past five years and it is a good illustration of a paradigm shift from object-oriented architecture, through component-based architecture to service-based architecture.

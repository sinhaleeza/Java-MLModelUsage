Web service composition enables seamless and dynamic integration of web services. The behavior of participant web services determines the overall performance of a composition. Therefore, it is important to choose the high quality participants for service composition. The state of the art in service discovery and selection rely on non-functional aspects also known as quality of service (QoS) e.g., response time and availability. Though these parameters are crucial for selecting web services, they do not reflect the end-user's perspective on quality. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adopting the perceived quality from end-user's perspective for service selection and composition. We name such quality parameters as quality of experience (QoE). First, we propose a solution that automatically mines and identifies QoE parameters from the web. Second, we study the application of such dynamically extracted QoE attributes for service selection. For the evaluation purpose, we collected more than 24,000 reviews from 22 different services from four domains. Our result shows the automated approach identifies QoE attributes with an average precision and recall 90% and 79% respectively. Our study shows that there is a strong positive correlation between QoS and QoE. Hence QoE can be used during service selection especially when QoS data are not available.

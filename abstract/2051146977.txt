In this work we present a case study of a SOA realization exercise at a business information provider firm, which deals with disparate sources of data in-order to provide reliable reports to its clients. Unlike typical enterprise scenarios, where applications are required to be service enabled, the key requirement here was to service enable its data acquisition, quality check, reporting and other processes which are either mostly manual or ETL based workflows. This paper also addresses how shared services, business processes, rules, and semantics are used to provide quality and agility to the internal processes many of which are entirely dependent on the type of data received. The case and the scenario are chosen specifically to emphasize the fact, that mere web-services implementation does not lead to service oriented architecture, but it is the appropriate usage of them.

The ability to react quickly to unpredictable changes in the environment is a key requirement in pervasive computing. This paper presents fANFARE, a framework for the autonomic management of service-oriented applications in pervasive environments. Specifically, it focuses on the configuration and optimization of pervasive applications deployed on OSGi platforms. We propose to handle runtime administration through a hierarchy of autonomic managers, that is a platform manager and a number of application managers and dependency managers. Our approach has been implemented and validated on pervasive use cases within the MEDICAL project funded by the French Ministry of Industry.

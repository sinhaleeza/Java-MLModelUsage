This paper discusses preliminary stages and key research challenges tackled by TEOS (experiments) in the EC funded BonFIRE project. TEOS experiments aim to determine the conditions for achieving resilient and optimal service compositions for very large scale service composition scenarios relating to Future Internet applications. We deploy and test two large scale service optimization models under different scenarios and configurations on the multi-site cloud infrastructure established by the EC BonFIRE initiative. The outcome of TEOS will not only verify the feasibility of the optimization models in dealing with large number of services and future-internet scenarios but also the nature and design of our experiments will help in evaluating the underlying BonFIRE infrastructure.

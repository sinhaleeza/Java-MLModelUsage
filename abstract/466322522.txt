Service monitoring is an important research problem in service-based systems (SBSs), which aims to monitor the failure of services in a timely manner while using resources as few as possible. Most of the existing service monitoring approaches are centralised which suffer the potential of single point of failure and are not suitable in distributed large scale SBSs. Moreover, these centralised monitoring approaches are designed only in single-tenant SBSs. Nowadays, the scale of SBSs is extremely large, i.e., including a large number of services and clients. Thus, it is essential for service monitoring approaches to work well in distributed large scale SBSs and support multi-tenancy. Towards this end, in this paper, an agent-based decentralised service monitoring approach is developed in multi-tenant SBSs. Compared to the centralised approaches, the proposed decentralised approach can avoid the single point of failure and can balance the computation over the monitoring agents. Also, unlike existing approaches, the proposed approach is developed in multi-tenant SBSs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can respond as quickly as centralised approaches but has much less computation overhead than centralised approaches.

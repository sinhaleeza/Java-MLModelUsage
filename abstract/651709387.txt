With the rapid growth of Web 2.0 and its related technologies, more and more composite services have been created by end-users. In the traditional composite service development workflow, the composite service descriptions have always to be manually written by end-users as soon as the services are either created or modified. As a result, these handcrafted descriptions could be irrelevant or out-of-date to the corresponding composite services. Also, the users who speak other languages can hardly understand the languages used in these descriptions. Therefore, we present an approach that automatically generates context-aware descriptions for composite services to improve the workflow of composite service development as a means of overcoming the drawbacks exposed in traditional end-user service composition workflows.

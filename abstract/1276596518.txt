This paper develops a wavelet based distributed ID model approach to analyses network traffic in detail. We adopt wavelet technique to analyze and model ID system to find the attack behavior in network. Our model can post attack characteristic more clearly and, by way of improve the veracity, we compare corresponding network node signals of wavelet decomposition. We simulate attacks and the model can detect attack more precisely than the previous model does.

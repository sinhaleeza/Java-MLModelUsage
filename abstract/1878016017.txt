The deployment of pricing schemes for communication services is driven by the network technologies. QoS is a major factor that affects the choice of a pricing scheme for a given network. In this paper, we explore a pricing scheme that uses service profiles, which define the QoS received from accessing a common resource pool. Through resource sharing between the profiles, maximisation of network resource utilisation is achieved. In this paper, the mathematical model of the proposed pricing scheme is presented, together with QoS evaluation results

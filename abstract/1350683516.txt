The paper presents an extensible resource encapsulation framework to encapsulate manufacturing resources into services following web service resource framework (WSRF) specification, which can make them offer their services and functionality in a standard web service environment. The encapsulation framework has many advantages such as extensible, plug-and-play deployment, automatic encapsulating and manageable. The design principle of the resource encapsulation framework is introduced in the paper. We developed the prototype of resource container for legacy binary codes, which can cast legacy binary codes into web services.

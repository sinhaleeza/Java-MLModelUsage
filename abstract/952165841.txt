Mobile applications are becoming more and more popular with the prevalence of mobile operating systems and mobile Internet. Many of them consume services provided by the underlying infrastructure and platforms as a part of their application environmental contexts. However, application failures or downgrade in performance may be the results due to inadequate provisions of these environmental issues in the implementations of the mobile applications. In this paper, we propose a framework to enable mobile applications to consume services offered by a reliable context provider with high probability in run time. We report a case study on a suite of five real-world mobile applications with 74 real faults on real mobile phones involving 50 users. The results of the case study show that our framework can significantly improve the reliability of mobile applications with respect to the failures due to buggy-context-provider faults with low slowdown and energy overheads.

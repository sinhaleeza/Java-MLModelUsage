Web services are gaining momentum as a major vehicle to deliver business functionalities on the Web. More and more business organizations have begun to use Web services to facilitate user interactions and the collaboration among themselves. This essentially forms a large service space, which still keeps growing. Meanwhile, there may be functionality overlaps among different service providers. The concept of Quality of Web Service (QoWS) is emerging as a key feature in distinguishing between competing service providers. We present in this paper a systematic approach for efficient service selection by using QoWS as the major criterion. In particular, we adopt a relational approach that enables to store QoWS information in a relational DBMS and leverage standard relational operators for efficient service selection. We perform a preliminary set of experiments to evaluate the proposed service selection algorithms.

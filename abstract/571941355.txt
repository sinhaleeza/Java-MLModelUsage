Mobile Internet and cloud computing are changing the paradigm of conventional business processes in service provision and demand. With the increasing user interaction and data transmission between mobile devices and workflow services, conventional business process pattern with centralized workflow engine is suffering from great challenges in service availability, reliability and user experience due to uncertain and changeable user contexts in mobile environments. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for process services based on dynamic multiple replicas of process instance to improve the reliability and efficiency of process services for mobile users in dynamic and instable environments. Also, we give both the replication and synchronization algorithm for process instances based on task dependency paths annotated with vector clocks, which aims to maximize the number of available process replicas during the replicating and synchronizing process. Simulation experiments indicate that the proposed system can provide much better availability and efficiency for process operations in mobile computing environments.

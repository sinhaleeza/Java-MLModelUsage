As the number of Web services grows and the diversity increases, it is imperative to bring semantics to Web services to provide richer descriptions. However, many solutions developed in the field of semantic annotation suffer from lack of relevant ontologies that are comprehensive enough to contain as many concepts as possible. Based on public open ontology, this paper presents an approach for augmenting semantics of Web services. For Web services in WSDL format, the semantics is enhanced by associating inputs and outputs with concepts from public open ontology. Then two methodologies based on match degree and service discovery respectively are described to evaluate the approach. With the support of OpenCyc, one experiment is carried out on OWLS-TC4 to test the effectiveness of the approach, the other experiment is conducted on 11836 WSDL files crawled from the Internet to expand the approach to a large number of Web services. The experimental results show that the approach performs well even when the number of Web services is large, moreover, it performs better when dealing with well-described Web services.

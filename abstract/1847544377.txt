The advent of mobile computing devices and development of wireless and ad-hoc networking technologies has led to growth of infrastructure-less environments. Mostly, these environments lie at the edges of Internet i.e. they are disconnected/sparsely connected to rest of the world. In order to exploit the access to such edges of Internet, we propose and experimentally evaluate an interoperability middleware that synergizes P2P technology, message queuing support and a passive distributed UDDI for Web services discovery and invocation.

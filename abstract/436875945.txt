Service-oriented enterprise platforms are increasingly called to support sense-and-respond capabilities in several application domains. In this context, Complex Event Processing is considered as a promising asset, as it enables to effectively extract meaningful events from raw data streams originated by sensing infrastructures, for enterprise processes and applications consumption. This paper proposes a novel CEP engine conceived with extensibility, interoperability, modularity and scalability requirements in mind. More specifically, we propose a Lightweight Stage-based Event Processor (LiSEP), based on a layered architectural design. Thanks to the adoption of Stage-Event Driven Architecture principles, core event processing logic is decoupled from low-level thread management issues. This results in an easy-to-understand and extensible implementation while testing results show performance scalability. We also report on the development of an ongoing case study on dangerous goods monitoring.

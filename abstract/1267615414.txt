Semantic descriptions are able to provide more accurate information on the characteristics of Web services, allowing these to be dynamically discovered without human intervention. Semantic web services can also be automatically composed through the use of discovery mechanisms able to identify inter-related services that can be combined together. This paper presents an approach for automatic discovery and composition of semantic Web services. The proposed approach allows services to be combined when a single service does not satisfy the requirements specified in a discovery request. In order to identify a composition, a mechanism that implements the proposed approach builds a graph of semantically matching services, based on the information annotated on service descriptions using the SAWSDL (Semantic Annotations for WSDL) standard.

During the execution of a QoS-aware service process, Web Services (WSs) may become faulty and cause the whole process to violate the predefined QoS constraints. Service processes need to adapt to the runtime faults so as to support reliable service-based applications. In this paper, we study the problem of runtime service process reconfiguration under end-to-end QoS constraints. An adaptive QoS-aware service process reconfiguration approach is proposed to solve the problem efficiently with low reconfiguration costs. In our approach, supplementary services are selected during service composition and then used as a backup source for efficient recovery, a region-based reconfiguration algorithm is proposed to minimize the reconfiguration cost by identifying a limited reconfiguration region that includes a small number of services. Experimental results show that, by using our approach, a high percentage of faulty service processes can be successfully reconfigured with high efficiency and significant cost savings.

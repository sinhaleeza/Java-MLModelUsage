Up to now, developing software for the Semantic Web is much more complex than developing software for other data representation paradigms, such as relational databases. Software development for relational databases is dramatically simplified by so-called object-relational mappers. Due to the conceptual difference between relational databases and the Semantic Web, the design patterns for object-relational mapping cannot directly be used for linked data. In this paper we show how design patterns for object-relational mapping can be used to achieve the more complex object triple mapping, which will make developing Semantic Web-enabled software much easier.

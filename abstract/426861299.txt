The increasing presence and adoption of Web services on the Web has promoted the significance of management of new service development for service developing sectors. The major challenge is that how to find missing but potentially valuable Web services to be developed. This problem can be divided into two sub-problems: finding missing Web services and measuring the added-value of the introduced services. This paper addresses a plausible solution to the first sub problem. Given a collection of Web services, we propose a framework for suggesting a set of candidate Web services that can be introduced to the collection. These suggested services are novel and do not present in the given collection. Our solution relies on the network structure of Web services for finding and recommending new Web services and utilizes the already observed properties of Web services networks for collective evaluation of the suggested services. The proposed solution is evaluated using 753 semantically annotated Web services. The experimental results shows that the proposed framework provides web service community with new network driven methods for finding and evaluation of new Web services.

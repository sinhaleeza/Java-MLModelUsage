As a common delivery model in cloud computing, SaaS applications are becoming increasingly popular. With the increasing of user's individual and diverse requirements, multi-tenancy has been the main delivery model for SaaS applications in future. Meanwhile, in order to adapt to the complex application development, application components had become modularization and fine-grained. Thus, new applications can be built through assembling those components quickly and agilely. So service composition for multi-tenant is the key to build application flexibly. This paper proposes a service granularity space for multi-tenant service composition based on granularity computing, which provides a semantic basis for multi-tenant service composition. The service granularity space supports the characteristic of hierarchy, inheritance, evolved correlation and versioning, effectively responding to the challenge of service composition for cloud computing SaaS applications. On the one hand, the service granularity space makes it possible to change disorder services into the hierarchy and ordered clustering services, and on the other hand, it makes it easy to develop multi-tenant SaaS applications by combining customization and evolution according to individual and diverse requirements. Our final experiments further demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of our proposed approaches.

Performance analysis is important for service clouds serving composite service application jobs containing parallelizable tasks, for optimizing the degree of parallelism (DOP) and resource allocation schemes could improve performance obviously. In this paper, we describe a novel tandem queuing network with a parallel multi-station multi-server system as an analytical model for service clouds serving composite service application jobs. We design a partition method (termed the 'pleasing partition') to help us propose an analytical model for parallelizable service which is the vital fraction of composite service. After that, we could obtain a complete probability distribution of response time, waiting time and other important performance metrics calculated by our proposed analytical model. Thus, to use this model, cloud operators could determine proper job configurations and resource allocation schemes, for achieving specific QoS (Quality of Service). Extensive simulations are conducted to validate that our analytical model has high accuracy in predicting performance metrics of composite service application jobs.

The paper describes a service oriented knowledge-based architecture to support supply chain application. The proposed architecture has the capability to meet the on- demand requirements of dynamic supply chains. Business requirements and potential benefits associated with our solution have been discussed. The research has led to an intelligent SOA application that is responsive to e- business requirements specifically in the supply chain sector. The design and implementation details of the SOA solution are given in details, which is supported through a software prototype.

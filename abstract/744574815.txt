The computing and networking capacities of today's wireless portable devices allow for ubiquitous services, which are seamlessly networked. Indeed, wireless handheld devices now embed the necessary resources to act as both service clients and providers. However, the ubiquitous networking of services remains challenged by the inherent mobility and resource constraints of the devices, which make services a priori highly volatile. This paper discusses the design, implementation, and experimentation of the ubiSOAP service-oriented middleware, which leverages wireless networking capacities to effectively enable the ubiquitous networking of services. ubiSOAP specifically defines a layered communication middleware that underlies standard SOAP-based middleware, hence supporting legacy Web Services while exploiting nowadays ubiquitous connectivity.

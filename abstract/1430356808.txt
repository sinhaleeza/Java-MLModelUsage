Mashup, a way to compose a new service from existing services, is expected to play a great role in internet of things (IoT) environment. Many recent researches suggest that mashup in IoT environment is possible with existing web mashup technology if each thing exposes its functionalities as a web service. However, this approach may have limitations in dealing with many heterogeneous devices and computation scalability in the presence of large number of things involved. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based IoT mashup service model, called IoT Mashup as a Service (IoTMaaS), to overcome heterogeneity of devices by following the model driven architecture principles and computational scalability based on cloud computing paradigm. We also design a cloud platform on which IoTMaaS be executed in harmony with stakeholders such as end users, device manufacturers, and cloud computing providers. We proved the concept of the architecture by implementing a prototype platform with an vacant room detection application.

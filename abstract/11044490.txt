This paper studies the quality of web service prediction problem. We formalize the QoS prediction problem by incorporating multiple contextual characteristics via collective matrix factorization that simultaneously factor the user-service quality matrix and contextual information matrices. Using the service category and location context, we develop three context-aware QoS prediction models and algorithms to demonstrate the advantages of this modeling technique. The advantages of our proposed models are demonstrated via experiments on real-life data sets.

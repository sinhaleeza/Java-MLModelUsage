This paper presents a service-oriented framework for the development of wrapper code generators, including the methodology of designing an effective wrapper program construction facility and a concrete implementation, called XWRAPComposer. Three unique features distinguish XWRAPComposer from existing wrapper development approaches. First, XWRAPComposer is designed to enable multi-stage and multi-page data extraction. Second, XWRAPComposer is the only wrapper generation system that promotes the distinction of information extraction logic from query-answer control logic, allowing higher level of robustness against changes in the service provider's Web site design or infrastructure. Third, XWRAPComposer provides a user-friendly plug-and-play interface, allowing seamless incorporation of external services and continuous changing service interfaces and data format.

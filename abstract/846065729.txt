Due to complex environment of the coal mine, it's necessary to monitor the information of underground environment, device and miner instantly in order to ensure the safety of coal mine production. However, the exiting coal mine can not meet the requirements of coverage without blind spots as it is developed by the wired network. This paper proposes a RESTful Web services mashup augmented coal mine safety monitoring and control automation using ZigBee wireless sensor network, which can collect the underground temperature, humidity methane values and personal position through sensor nodes in the coal mine, and also collects the personnel position information inside the mine, and then implement a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) on sensor nodes to provide access to sensors and actuators, allowing for them to be easily combined with other enterprise information resources based on the success of mashup applications. We also illustrated three different of scenarios for RESTful Web service mashups representing for coal mine safety monitoring and control automation. Finally, we give the conclusions.

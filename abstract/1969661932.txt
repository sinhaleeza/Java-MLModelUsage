The virtual enterprise (VE), which joins many enterprises in order to share their costs, skills and resources in supporting a certain goal, is playing an important role in e-commerce. In a VE, how information is shared among participants is a difficult problem. The emergence of Web services provides us with a new method to resolve it. In this paper, we propose a framework of a Web services based intranet in VE (WIVE). Its focus is on the idea of information retrieval based on ontology. By the use of ontology and agent technology, we bring semantics to Web services in the VE intranet and improve the correctness of information retrieval.

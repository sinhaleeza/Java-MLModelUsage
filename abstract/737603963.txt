Predicting the Quality of Service (QoS) values is important since they are widely applied to Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) research domain. Previous research works on this problem do not consider the influence of user location information carefully, which we argue would contribute to improving prediction accuracy due to the nature of Web services invocation process. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative QoS prediction framework with location-based regularization (LBR). We first elaborate the popular Matrix Factorization (MF) model for missing values prediction. Then, by taking advantage of the local connectivity between Web services users, we incorporate geographical information to identify the neighborhood. Different neighborhood situations are considered to systematically design two location-based regularization terms, i.e. LBR1 and LBR2. Finally we combine these regularization terms in classic MF framework to build two unified models. The experimental analysis on a large-scale real-world QoS dataset shows that our methods improve 23.7% in prediction accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms in general cases.

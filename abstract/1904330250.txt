Data Web service composition is a powerful means to answer users' complex queries. User preferences are a key aspect that must be taken into account in the composition scheme. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically compose Data Web services while taking into account the user preferences. User preferences are modeled thanks to fuzzy sets. We use an RDF query rewriting algorithm to determine the relevant services. The fuzzy constraints of the relevant services are matched to those of the query using a set of matching methods. We rank-order services using a justification of Pareto dominance, then compute the top-k service compositions. We propose also a method to improve the diversity of returned compositions while maintaining as possible the compositions with the highest scores. Finally, we present a thorough experimental study of our approach.

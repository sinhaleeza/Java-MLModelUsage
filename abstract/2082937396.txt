A XML service is a software component that supports interoperable application-to-application interaction over a network. Each service makes its functionality available through well-defined or standardized XML interfaces. Aviation XML services refer to the services that make operating an airplane in air and on ground possible. In this paper, we present an emergency response framework to organize the aviation XML services to work cooperatively on mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). A MANET is defined as a self-organized and rapidly deployed network of XML services in order to exchange information without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. Note that the framework does not have to be limited to the aviation sector. The methodology can also be adopted into other MANET computing scenarios including: natural disaster communications (e.g., tsunami, earthquakes), emergency relief scenarios, car-based networks, and the provision of wireless connectivity in remote areas.

Service composition is nowadays mainly seen as a once-for-all activity. Supporting a dynamic service world, where both available services and needs may change, requires runtime adaptive features for service composition. In this paper we propose a repair technique for internal composition adaptation, as opposed to external adaptation. Moreover, setting up our proposal in the planning framework, we compare our repair technique with reference to re-composition, that is re-planning.

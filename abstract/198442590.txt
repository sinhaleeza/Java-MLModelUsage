We envision users discovering suitable Web objects and configuring them on-the-fly with their desired high-level application logic, with the programming and deployment carried out entirely on the Web. Easy configurability and interplay of Web entities implies evolution of a few common sense, yet powerful set of core primitives for effective coordination, akin in simplicity and strength to the HTTP protocol. Current Web services technology lacks Infrastructure support, theoretical sound fundamental framework for Web services coordination and composition, and easy use tools for Web application development. Our Web coordination bond system gears towards finding solutions to aforementioned research challenges.

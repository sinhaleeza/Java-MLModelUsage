In this paper, we provide an analysis of the impacts of some reputation parameters that an agent-based Web service holds while being active in the environment. To this end, we deploy a reputation model that ranks the Web services with respect to their popularity in the network of users. We model and analyze the arrival of requests and study their impacts on the overall reputation. The Web services may be encouraged to handle the peak loads by gathering to a group. Besides theoretical discussions, we also provide significant results, which elaborate more on the details of the system parameters. We extend the details of these results to empirical results and link the observations of the implemented environment to the results that we theoretically obtain.

This paper addresses issues relating to the efficient access and discovery of Web services across multiple UDDI business registries (UBRs). The ability to explore Web services across multiple UBRs is becoming a challenge particularly as size and magnitude of these registries increase. As Web services proliferate, finding an appropriate Web service across one or more service registries using existing registry APIs (i.e. UDDI APIs) raises a number of concerns such as performance, efficiency, end-to-end reliability, and most importantly quality of returned results. Clients do not have to endlessly search accessible UBRs for finding appropriate Web services particularly when operating via mobile devices. Finding relevant Web services should be time effective and highly productive. In an attempt to enhance the efficiency of searching for businesses and Web services across multiple UBRs, we propose a novel exploration engine, the Web service crawler engine (WSCE). WSCE is capable of crawling multiple UBRs, and enables for the establishment of a centralized Web services' repository which can be used for large-scale discovery of Web services. The paper presents experimental validation, results, and analysis of the presented ideas.

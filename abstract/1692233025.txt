As more and more Web services are deployed, Web service's discovery mechanisms become essential. Similar services can have quite different QoS levels. For service selection and management purpose, it is necessary to explicitly, precisely, and unambiguously specify various constraints and QoS metrics for Web services descriptions. This paper provides a novel DAML-QoS ontology as a complement for DAML-S ontology to provide a better QoS metrics model. Three layers are defined together with clear role descriptions for developments. Cardinality constraints are utilized to describe the QoS property constraints. Basic profile is presented for general Web service's description and the speed startup of ontology definition. Matchmaking algorithm for QoS property constraints is presented and different matching degrees are described. When incorporated with DAML-S, multiple service levels can be described through attaching multiple QoS profiles to one service profile. Well-defined Metrics can be further utilized by measurement organizations to guarantee the promised service level.

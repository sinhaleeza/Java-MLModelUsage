We propose a new framework for composing Sensor-Cloud services based on dynamic features such as spatio-temporal aspects. To evaluate spatio-temporal Sensor-Cloud services, two new quality attributes are introduced. We present a heuristic algorithm based on A* to compose Sensor-Cloud services in terms of spatio-temporal aspects. In addition, a new spatio-temporal technique based on 3D R-tree to access Sensor-Cloud services is proposed. Analytical and simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed approach.

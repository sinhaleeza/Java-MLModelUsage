A variety of extended transaction models have been proposed in distributed database community, and the development of such models has drawn more attentions since they are not adequate for long-running Web services. From a formal method perspective, a Flexible transaction model for Web services based on MPi-calculus is proposed in this work. MPi-calculus, without introducing any new operators, creates the dynamic association between the changes of transaction scope and their interactive actions in the original Pi-calculus. According to the flexible transaction dependency, a new weak transactional open bisimulation relationship is presented to characterize the transactional equivalence. All of the results can serve as the theoretical foundation to model flexible and powerful mechanisms for implementing long-running transactions.

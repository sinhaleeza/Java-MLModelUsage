This study proposes an experience evaluation model (EEM), indicating how service experience can be estimated within interaction-based collaborative service systems with (semi-)automated value co-production between service providers and receivers. A symbiosis theory in ecology is employed to measure the performance of collaboration. The proposed EEM is based on three measurements - proximate response (PR), ultimate response (UR), and evolve dependence (ED) - that measure performance deviation before and after being affected by customer inputs and interaction in service process. The performance can be measured by the fitness of the interaction between service participants effecting of value co-production. The fitness for a provider and receiver can then be determined using life reproducibility success (LRS) based on mutualism performance theory, which facilitates estimation of user's collaborative experience. On one hand, monitoring service performance to explore service experiences, on the other hand, optimizing the interaction-based collaborative service systems through EEM.

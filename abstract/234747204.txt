Quality of individual services is substantial to guarantee high performance and availability of overall composite service oriented systems. This requires the process of diagnosing service quality degradation and responding to it in a timely and non-stopping manner. This paper presents a modeling-based approach to coordinate the process of Web service management, configuring parameters or invoking other tasks. This approach uses executable process models to represent diagnosis logic and orchestrate the replacement. The process models can interact with the system and accept administrators' instruction at the process level. As a result, a service can be automatically replaced by the best available strategy without any downtime of the overall system. Our approach is implemented on an architecture of Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that allows intercepting services and redirecting messages with little performance penalty. The experiment demonstrates the efficiency of this approach using a loan-brokering Web service on ESB.

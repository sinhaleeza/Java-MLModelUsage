With the increase in the number of cars in big cities, it has become a nightmare for car owners to find available parking spaces. Some studies report that around 25-30% traffic on the roads are cars finding available spaces for parking. While many researches have been conducted to create a smart parking system, most of them only focus on some particular areas and environments without any common standards. As a result, this hurts users' experience as they have to use many different applications to access various APIs when traveling to different places. Thus, in this study, we wish to open the discussion to realize a global and common base for smart parking services by proposing a smart parking systems based on GS1 global standards. By utilizing common and global standards, our proposed architecture could be used globally and also easy to extend with different services. We have also implemented a prototype system which can support parking lots in Busan city and 9 Korean Airports to prove the feasibility of our architecture.

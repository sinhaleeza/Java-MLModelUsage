Service contracts function as interfaces which bridge IT implementation, business modeling, and economical analysis among stakeholder. We report a review of recent research/practice(to be completed) with focus on contract content and contract management. Dimensions of { Quality of data(QoD), Quality of service(QoS), Legal issue,&nbsp;&nbsp;Context, Business term } and { Description of contract, Monitor/Control, Selection, Matchmaking, Composition } are empirically chosen for evaluation purpose. We also propose future directions.

End-users conduct various on-line activities. Quite often, they re-visit websites and use services to perform re-occurring activities, such as on-line shopping. The end-users are required to enter the same information into various web services to accomplish such re-occurring tasks. It can negatively impact user experience when a user needs to type the re-occurring information repetitively into such web services. In this paper, we propose an approach to prevent end-users from performing such repetitive tasks. Our approach propagates user inputs across services by linking similar input and output parameters. Our approach pre-fills values to the input parameters for an end-user using his or her previous inputs. To increase the chance of identifying a proper value for an input parameter performed by one end-user, our approach also leverages the inputs from other end-users. We identify and link similar end-users to enable the propagation of user inputs among end-users. We have designed and developed a prototype. We also conduct an empirical study to evaluate our approach using the real world services. The empirical results show that our approach using an end-user's previous inputs can reduce on average 41 percent of repetitive typing for the execution of composed services. Furthermore, the previous inputs from the similar end-users can improve our approach in reducing the repetitive typing for an end-user.

As the number of Web services surges rapidly, recommending the right service for various users on demand has become one of the most challenging research issues in the fields of services computing and cloud computing. This special issue focuses on the recommendation techniques for services computing and cloud computing including classic recommendation algorithms for services computing and cloud computing, emerging recommendation techniques for service selection and composition, and applications of recommendation techniques in composition of complex service mashups, ad-hoc social networks, and green cloud environment. The papers introduced in this special issue illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of services computing and cloud computing, while demonstrating a variety of challenges that arise. It is expected that this special issue, as a whole, will provide integrated and synthesized view of the current state of the art, identify key challenges, possible research directions and opportunities for investigation, and promote community-building efforts among researchers and practitioners in the related fields.

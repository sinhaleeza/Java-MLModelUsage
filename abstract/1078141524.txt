Hosting Web services on mobile and wireless devices is challenging because of their limited resources. A few efforts have been made to facilitate hosting of Web services on such devices, but the proposed solutions do not always conform to the multiple Web service standards and security frameworks that have been proposed by the Web service community. Secondly, the performance of these solutions is often limited due to the resource limitations of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by introducing a novel system partitioning technique to be used by a web service provider so that a few WS components can be executed on an intermediate node. The use of the proposed partitioning technique for a WS execution environment has shown a significant performance improvement. The proposed partitioning technique is analyzed using a prototype WS execution environment hosting sample Web services.

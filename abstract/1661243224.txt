The rise of dynamic applications is coming with new development challenges. Indeed, dynamism is a complex concern, difficult to perceive and manage by developers. In the context of a large industrial project dealing with fleet management, we had to deal with important environmental and evolutionary dynamism. To make it easier for the development team, we have used and extended the iPOJO service component model. This paper presents how the dynamism is described in component metadata and how it is managed at runtime. The extensions have been integrated into the Apache Felix iPOJO source code.

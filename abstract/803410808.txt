Semantic Web services (SWSs) extend current Web services standards to help facilitate their usages. While current SWS approaches have shown some early promising results, they have focused on somewhat unrealistic use-cases that make various problematic assumptions and focus on somewhat farfetched usage scenarios. In this paper we present a category of use case scenarios for SWSs that centers around keeping human users in the automation process while facilitating their activities. We demonstrate our approach with a simplified scenario and highlight some of the details of our architecture and implementation. Finally, we also discuss how our approach could be extended and applied in other domains; namely, the domain of asset-based business approach to creating IT computing infrastructure

Web services search and discovery systems have received a great deal of attention recently. However, little attention has been given to a Web services filtering system. In this paper, we propose a design and architecture of a semantic Web services filtering system called SWFilter. SWFilter uses Prufer sequences transformed from Web services and user queries. The filtering process is performed in a bottom-up manner. Ontology information and compositions of Web services are also considered in the filtering process.

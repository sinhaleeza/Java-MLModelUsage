Due to a rapidly increasing volume of information and autonomous services, domain experts spend considerable time and effort in correlating and integrating these resources into meaningful business processes. In this paper we present IRIS, a framework that effectively supports users in creating service compositions with the special focus on interoperability. We illustrate our work by means of a scientific business process from the area of life science informatics. For the sake of adaptability and reusability our approach relies on a component-based mediator model. The problem of mediator discovery and composition is addressed by an ontology-based registry approach.

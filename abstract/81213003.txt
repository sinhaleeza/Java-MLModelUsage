OpenCCS is an SLA-aware resource management system which uses transparent checkpointing of applications and migration of checkpoint datasets for ensuring SLA-compliance also in case of resource outages. Migration of checkpoints presumes a high grade of compatibility between source and target resource. Hence, even in large Grid systems only a small number of resources are eligible migration targets. This short paper describes the concept of virtual execution environments and how they increase the number of potential migration targets. It will also outline an implementation within OpenCCS.

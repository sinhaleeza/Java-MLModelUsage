As Web services and service oriented architectures are adopted, it is increasingly important to have standard and interoperable means to deploy and configure Web services. Within the Global Grid Forum, HP, NEC, and Softricity have been developing a standard for configuration description, deployment, and lifecycle management (CDDLM). In order to prove its feasibility, reference implementations are being developed. This paper describes an independent reference implementation of CDDLM and the experience in using Web Services for deployment in a standardized manner. Our main contributions are: the lessons learned in implementing this WS-based standard and an architecture for implementing CDDLM

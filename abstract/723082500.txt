We propose a new social-sensor cloud services trust model. We propose to represent social media data streams, i.e., images' meta-data and related posted information, as social-sensor cloud services. Images' meta-data and the related posted information are abstracted as the functional and non-functional aspects of the social-sensor cloud services. The trustworthiness of a social-sensor cloud service is measured based on the users' stance based trust model. We use the textual features of the social-sensor cloud services, i.e., comments and meta-data, e.g., spatio-temporal information to gather the trust-rate of the service. Analytical results are presented to show the performance of the proposed model with real datasets.

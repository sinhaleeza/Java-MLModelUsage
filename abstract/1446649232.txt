The hybrid semantic Web service matchmaker WSMOMX applies different matching filters to retrieve WSML service descriptions that are semantically relevant to a given query with respect to seven degrees of hybrid matching. These degrees are recursively computed by aggregated valuations of ontology-based type matching, logical constraint and relation matching, and syntactic similarity as well. In this paper, we provide results of our experimental evaluation of the performance of WSMO-MX. In summary, it turned out that hybrid semantic matching of WSML-MX services can outperform logic-based only semantic service matching.

The flying increase of the requirement for business and scientific computing promotes the development of grid computing, where grid service is the basic unit for modelling computing resources. Integrating grid service with the J2EE resources, such as EJB, JMS and JCA, is a practically feasible approach to make good use of the J2EE computing resources. In addition, J2EE offers an ideal running environment for GT3. We propose an effective integration strategy to integrate the grid service and JCA, to which is not paid enough attention currently. We first present a perspective view of each concept (such as grid service, GT3, and JCA), then put forth the integration strategy in depth, further, we offer a framework of the encapsulating grid services definition. A simple example is also worked out to exemplify the strategy.

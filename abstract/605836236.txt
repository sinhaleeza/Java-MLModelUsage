Evolution of process-aware information systems necessitates several modifications to business process models with time. To be able to trace the evolving process models, there is a crucial need of systematic and modular enhancements of processes driven by functional and non-functional requirements. Hence, it is beneficial to record the history of modifications through versions of process models for unforeseen situations. In this paper, we present patterns for process edification that ensures systematic modifications to process models establishing traceability. We introduce process edification through the notion of edification cuts based on patterns applied on process models that results in an enhancement of the model into one of its improved version. The changes over process models occurring in a trace are quantified using various metrics. The approach is applied on different evolving industrial process models and the results are discussed.

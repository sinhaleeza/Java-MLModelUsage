Privacy becomes an increasing concern in modern society because personal information is being collected by more and more online services on the Internet. Although many privacy-aware models and methods were proposed, the protection technology of privacy is underway. This paper aims at addressing privacy-aware access control in composite services. We introduce an automaton-based monitoring solution for privacy-vital information flow for a single execution of a composite service. In addition, this paper also gives a policy consolidation algorithm based on orchestration structures and attribute composition, which can also be used to combine privacy policies.

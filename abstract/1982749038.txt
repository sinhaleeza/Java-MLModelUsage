Social tagging has become a popular solution for recognition and management of resources in web2.0 era. To solve the current problem of insufficient capacity of semantic description of web services, a multi-dimensional social tagging method for semantics of web services is proposed. Under the guidance of general social tagging model, users will annotate services manually from the domain the services attribute to, services theme and self reference, and simultaneously, the functional and nonfunctional properties of the services are automatically tagged, so that the semantic description coverage rate of web services will be enhanced, Moreover, a method of service semantics emerge automatically is proposed. Finally, experimental analysis will verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

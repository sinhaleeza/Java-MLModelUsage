We propose a novel dynamic metaheuristic optimization approach to compose an optimal set of IaaS service requests to align with an IaaS provider's long-term economic expectation. This approach is designed for the context that the IaaS provisioning subjects to resource and QoS constraints. In addition, the IaaS service requests have the features of dynamic resource and QoS requirements and variable arrival times. A new economic model is proposed to evaluate the similarity between the provider's long-term economic expectation and a composition of service requests. The evaluation incorporates the factors of dynamic pricing and operation cost modeling of the service requests. An innovative hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed that incorporates the economic inter-dependency among the requests as a heuristic operator and performs repair operations in local solutions to meet the resource and QoS constraints. The proposed approach generates dynamic global solutions by updating the heuristic operator at regular intervals with the runtime behavior data of an existing service composition. Experimental results preliminarily prove the feasibility of the proposed approach.

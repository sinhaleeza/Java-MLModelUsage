This paper introduces the concept of the Logistics Service Map, a modular service construction system with an inherent catalog function. Specialized service providers, so called logistics integrators are to use this concept to integrate subsidiary service providers into logistics networks. The main purpose of the Service Map is to enable and to foster the development of atomic as well as composite logistics services used by the integrator to fulfill customers' requirements. After a brief presentation of the applied research methodology, the current progress of research is outlined and a draft of future research activities and discussion points is given.

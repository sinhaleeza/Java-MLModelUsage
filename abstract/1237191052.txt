A satisfactory solution for data-intensive web service is required to overcome the problems of web service performance and scalability. We address these problems and propose service atomization, a new approach in atomizing information analysis that tackles large scale information. It uses a measure to ease the creation and collaboration of services. We call this measure service enthalpy, which comprises enthalpy of data intensification, functionality simplification, analysis shall owing and data uniformization.

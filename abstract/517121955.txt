In a service-oriented system (SoS), service requests define tasks to execute and quality of service (QoS) criteria to optimize. A service request is submitted to the service selector in the SoS, which allocates tasks to the service that can 'best' satisfy the given QoS criteria. When the selector cannot optimize simultaneously the given QoS criteria, users need to specify priorities and preferences over the said criteria. Accounting for users' QoS priorities and preferences is therefore necessary during service selection.

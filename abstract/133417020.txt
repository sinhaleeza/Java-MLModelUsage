Modeling and deployment of e-contracts is a challenging task because of the involvement of both technological and business aspects. There are several frameworks and systems available in the literature. Some works mainly deal with the automatic handling of paper contracts and others provide monitoring and enactment of contracts. Because contracts evolve, it is useful to have a system that models and enacts the evolution of e-contracts.

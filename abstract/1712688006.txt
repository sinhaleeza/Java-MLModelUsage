In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on how to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance for services with commutative operations. Recent research suggests that services may be implemented using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for highly efficient optimistic replication with the crash-fault model. We extend such studies by adopting the Byzantine fault model, which encompasses crash faults as well as malicious faults. We carefully analyze the threats towards the operations in a system constructed with CRDTs, and propose a lightweight solution to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance with low runtime overhead. We define a set of correctness properties for such systems and prove that the proposed Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms guarantee these properties. Furthermore, we show that our mechanisms exhibit excellent performance with a proof-of-concept replicated shopping cart service constructed using CRDTs.

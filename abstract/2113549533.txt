Traditionally, system and network management software is tightly tied with the managed IT resources through their specific manageability interfaces, such as SNMP, CIM, WMI, JMX. Because Web service distributed management specification (WSDM), as an initiative of OASIS organization, helps to build the SOA-support manageability interfaces of IT resources, we proposed SOAMS-a novel SOA-based system and network management scheme and WSDM-based management middle mode for SOAMS. As part of experiment work, we discuss MUSE-JMX based management scheme implementation- SOAMS-platform, including manager layer, WSDM-gateway layer, and agent layer, and then analyze the prospective research direction.

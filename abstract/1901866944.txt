This paper discusses a solution based on Web services and service oriented architecture involving interorganizational information systems in the context of multichannel integration in retailing industry. Distribution intensive industries such as retailing have seen a proliferation of distribution channels. This is in part triggered by the intense competition as well as the retailers' drive to reach the customers through all possible channels. As the number of channels for a retailer increases, managing the dynamics of customer behavior in the multichannel environment becomes complex. Customers have an option of interacting with retailers across a number of channels. Acquiring and retaining customers requires that relationship management applications should be able to accommodate the various channels. In this paper, we provide an overview of the benefits of using Web services in multichannel integration and related retail processes. We propose a reference service oriented architecture for usage of Web services involving inter and intra company systems for multichannel integration.

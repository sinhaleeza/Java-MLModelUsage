Service oriented computing (SOC) allows resources on a network to be made available as services. For a business service, differentiated services can be provided based on the usage context, i.e., location, age, purpose and user profiles. In differentiated services, service outcomes depend on context. Currently there is no efficient technical solution for supporting differentiated service development. In this paper we present an approach to deliver differentiated services realized by configurable business processes so that service flexibility, manageability and reusability can be achieved.

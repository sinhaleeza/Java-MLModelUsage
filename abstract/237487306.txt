While the traditional model driven development techniques are useful for building solutions in a reusable manner, they do not say much about how the existing assets in a client environment can be leveraged effectively and efficiently. In this work, we enhance model driven transformation techniques to generate implementation artifacts on a given platform from platform independent models while leveraging the existing assets in a client environment. We apply semantic Web service matching technology to achieve automatic binding of generated artifacts with available client assets. By generating implementation artifacts that are bound where appropriate with clientspsila existing functionality, our approach helps cut down the development time during project implementations and thereby resulting in reduced project durations and costs. We demonstrate the feasibility of the two platforms: IBM WebSphere and SAP NetWeaver. Lessons learned are presented.

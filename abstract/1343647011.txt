Web services allow devices running on different platforms to communicate with one another using standardized definitions and access ways. Due to recent developments in mobile networks and devices, many researches are on going to apply Web services to mobile network environments. In this paper, we propose an efficient method that discovers services based on a proposed mobility-based clustering in mobile ad-hoc networks. In order to maintain stable clusters and select a proper service discovery architecture, the proposed method uses the mobility of nodes including direction. Experimental results under different mobility models show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional clustering and service discovery method.

The Internet market is highly competitive and is influenced by high expectation levels of Internet users, continuous advancement in the information technology, and high processing and storage capabilities of the hardware. In this work, we focus on the design and development of a replicated and highly available service registry for microservice architectures. The service registry key-value store comprises six nodes and supports a total of 216 microservices. Existing replicated service registries, like ZooKeeper and ETCD, are based on majority consensus strategies. Moreover, if these strategies fail to achieve majority consensus, then the service registries are bound to provide limited functionality. As part of this research, we propose a highly available data replication strategy for a replicated service registry (DRSR). DRSR exploits 1) a simple encoding scheme and 2) a mapping method for efficient distribution of the encoded values to the service registry nodes in order to overcome the limitations faced by existing strategies.

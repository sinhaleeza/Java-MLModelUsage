We present our work-in-progress on making an analytic data fusion service, originally developed and deployed to support high-performance computing and cloud-based applications, available in a enterprise service-oriented architecture (SOA) environment. We posit that not only can SOA-based integration of research software be useful in enterprise business use cases, but also that providing ways to integrate domain-specific and enterprise data is beneficial. We describe use cases driving our work, our data fusion service and its analytic capabilities, and our integration efforts using an open-source enterprise service bus framework.

The easiest way for a user to express his needs regarding a desired service is to use natural language. The main issues come from the fact that the natural language is incomplete and ambiguous, while the service composition process should lead to valid services. In this paper we propose a natural language service assemblage method based on composition templates (patterns). The use of templates assures that the composition result is always valid. The proposed system, called NLSC (Natural Language Service Composer), was implemented on the top of a service-oriented middleware called WComp and tested in an intelligent home environment.

We are concerned with reliably harvesting data used to monitor a service-based system hosted in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) environment. These data are time-bounded, time-sensitive time-series data recorded by individual hosts in the network. Harvesting is used to gather the data for global time-series analyses, such as fault localization. The MANET environment challenges data harvesting, due to the inherently unstable and unpredictable connectivity and the resource limitations of wireless devices. We present an epidemic, delay tolerant method to improve the availability of time-series monitoring data in the presence of network instabilities, asymmetries, and partitions. The method establishes a network-wide synchronization overlay to incrementally and efficiently move data to intermediate nodes. We have implemented the algorithm in Java EE and evaluated it in the CORE and EMANE MANET emulation environments.

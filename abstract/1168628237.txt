Account services are playing important roles in building IT ecosystems, such as Google Accounts, Apple ID and Microsoft Your Account for the forthcoming windows 8. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to build a cloud oriented account service for SME SaaS Ecosystem (SSE), a public cloud ecosystem among small and medium sized enterprises of China. Different from the account services listed above, our account service has been established not only for individuals, but also for enterprises. Characteristics of the account service are as follows: 1) multi-tenant oriented implementation through virtual directory Information Tree (DIT) views based on a hybrid data structure; 2) partition based distributed architecture enables the service sufficiently calable and available; and 3) GUI based interfaces for configuration management, RESTful and SOAP based interfaces for the third party services invoking.

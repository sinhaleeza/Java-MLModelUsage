Typically, BPMN Designer only needs to consider the business process without knowing the detail of invoked service, which helps them to simplify the design procedure. However, in some data centric workflow scenario, if designer didn't know about the data model of the invoked service, the BPMN workflow execution will be inefficient due to data conflict. There is lack of dynamically data modeling capability in BPMN, which means some data conflicts might happen in the designed workflow. To solve the problem, this paper introduced a hybrid model combining process and data, which is called process-data (PD) model. PD model defined several data conflict scenarios, which transformed the conflicting problem into parallel collection constructing problem. A novel collection generating method is introduced for the parallel collection creation. Based on the output of method, user can find a way to optimize the data conflict and increase the performance of the workflow.

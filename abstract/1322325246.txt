Collaborative Decision Processes focus on long-running, multi-faceted decisions (e.g., the planning and approval process for a municipal development project) made by teams of people. Such decisions can draw on the crowd in a variety of ways, by enabling large-scale on-line brainstorming, crowd-sourced queries, and text mining to determine public sentiments and derive new insights. Such decision processes consist of a combination of structured and highly unconstrained, human-drive activities. This paper describes a framework and a prototype system for support of collaborative decision processes based on declarative, data-centric dynamic artifacts and Advanced Case Management.

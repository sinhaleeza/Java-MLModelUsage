Web Services are emerging technologies that enable application-to-application communication and reuse of autonomous services over the Web. Recent efforts, OWLS, model the semantics of Web Services that includes the capabilities of the service, the service interaction protocol, and the actual messages for service exchanges. However, there is a need to automate discovery, selection and execution of OWL-S services. Further, a framework that meets the quality of service (QoS) requirements for ad hoc Internet based services is rarely provided. In this paper, we have proposed a rule-based framework, called SetnWebQ, which manages workflows composed of Semantic Web Services. SemWebQ is capable of conducting QoS-based adaptive selection as well as dynamic binding and execution of Web Services according to the semantics of workflow, thereby rendering a resilient and adaptive Web based service flow. A series of experiments performed on the SemWebQ with real Web Services have confirmed the effectiveness of proposed framework with respect to adaptive selection and execution of the Web Services in Web based workflows.

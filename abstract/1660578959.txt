Reuse of process knowledge, especially organizational specific process knowledge is of great help to business process management efforts. The amount of such knowledge maybe large and ever growing, so the first step of process knowledge reuse is retrieving. A business goal oriented process knowledge retrieving method is introduced. The reuseable process knowledge is organized into process units. A Process Unit semantic description framework is defined. Business goal is also defined using semantic based model. User defined goal description is transformed into target process knowledge description, and used as input of a PK retrieving algorithm on the PK repository. User requirements on target process's functionality, performance and compatibility with collaborative processes are concerned in the retrieving process. The approach is aimed at providing direct and semi-automatic instructions on business process management operations towards business goal achieving.

To add descriptive ability to knowledge representation (KR) system based on OWL, many extensions to OWL are proposed to augment its expressive power. Many of these extensions take the approach by changing the syntax and semantic of the description logic corresponding to OWL. A new approach is proposed in this paper by using a dynamic concept interpretation method without changing the structure of original description logic. This approach provides a flexible extension mechanism outside the description logic framework, which will not bring any additional logical computational complexity or uncertainty to the original description logic. And various implementations can be realized through this approach for different extension purposes.

This paper presents a novel Web-based service-oriented framework to support collaborative product commerce. The framework coordinates processes to design and manufacture a product in a loosely coupled environment using Web services. We have developed a service model using OWL. It provides facilities for companies to discover services that other companies provide. Choreography of Web services is achieved using the process grammar. Usage of process grammar helps to configure processes dynamically, facilitating collaboration among companies. The framework, therefore, provides a truly distributed architecture for management of service composition and interoperation, lending a unique functionality to the framework.

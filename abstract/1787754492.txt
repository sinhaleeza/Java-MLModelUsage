In this paper, we propose a novel learning classifier system with the cooperative co-evolutionary mechanism to obtain accurate user preference information in context-aware mobile service adaptation. Our system can generate new user's initial classifier population to accelerate its converging speed and also help the current user to predict the action corresponding to an uncovered context. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our system for mobile service adaptation.

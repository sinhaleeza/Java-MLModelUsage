Mobile learning in massive open online course (MOOC) evidently differs from its traditional ways as it relies more on collaborations and becomes more fragmented. We present a cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) which can organize learners into a better teamwork context and customize micro learning resources in order to meet personal demands in real time. Particularly, a smart micro learning environment was built by a newly designed Software as a Service (SaaS), namely Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It aims to provide adaptive micro learning contents as well as learning path identifications customized for each individual learner. To personalize the micro learning, a dynamic learner model is constructed with regards to the internal and external factors that can affect learning experience and outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) techniques are employed as the main method to understand learners' behaviors and recognize learning resource features. A solution of learning path optimization is also proposed towards assembling a complete MOOC learning experience.

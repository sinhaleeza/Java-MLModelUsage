With the rapid development of Web2.0 and its related technologies, Mashup services (i.e., Web applications created by combining two or more Web APIs) are becoming a hot research topic. The explosion of Mashup services, especially the functionally similar or equivalent services, however, make services discovery more difficult than ever. In this paper, we present an approach to recommend Mashup services to users based on user interest and social network of services. This approach firstly extracts users' interests from their Mashup service usage history and builds a social network based on social relationships information among Mashup services, Web APIs and their tags. The approach then leverages the target user's interest and the social network to perform Mashup service recommendation. Large-scale experiments based on a real-world Mashup service dataset show that our proposed approach can effectively recommend Mashup services to users with excellent performance. Moreover, a Mashup service recommendation prototype system is developed.

In this paper we propose a technique for the automated synthesis of new composite Web services. Given a set of abstract BPEL4WS descriptions of component services, and a composition requirement, we automatically generate an executable BPEL4WS process that, once deployed, is able to interact with the components to satisfy the requirement. We implement the proposed approach exploiting efficient synthesis techniques, and experiment with some case studies taken from real world applications and with a parameterized domain. We show that the technique can scale up to cases in, which the manual development of BPEL4WS composite services is not trivial and is time consuming.

Compared with packaged application, custom application developments (CAD) experience the frustration of higher project overhead and less certainty. The typical time spent on building the infrastructure for a CAD project is, on average, several weeks. Project uncertainty comes from unique customer requirements and lack of standardized methods and toolsets to follow. Therefore, a CAD project is more difficult to achieve cost reduction and asset reuse. In this paper, we present a cloud platform to alleviate this problem through an integration of a) standard methods, b) standardized toolsets aligned with those methods, c) project management environments with pre-defined work breakdown structure (WBS) aligned with those methods and toolsets, and d) infrastructure support from the cloud technology. We believe that such a cloud platform will become a fundamental approach for large enterprises to develop CAD or other solutions for their clients.

Data-flow requirements is an important aspect of service composition. Although several approaches have been proposed to specify data-flow requirements, they cannot be efficiently exploited in dynamic setting, for example, where the composition participants (i.e., component services) need to be dynamically replaced. In this paper, we propose a new modeling methodology for data-flow requirements, in which we explicitly distinguish a data model of a composite service from data models of component services. We show that following our methodology, a composition can be adjusted to various dynamic changes with significantly less effort. We implement our solution using planning techniques and make its basic evaluation on a scenario from the travel domain.

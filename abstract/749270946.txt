The end-to-end QoS negotiation for SLA establishment for composite services involves compound multi-party negotiations in which the composite service provider concurrently negotiates with multiple candidates for each atomic service, selecting the ones that best satisfy the atomic service QoS preferences while ensuring that end-to-end QoS requirements are also fulfilled. In order to negotiate with potential candidates, it is necessary to derive the atomic utility boundaries from the global utility boundary. Additionally, there needs to be a mechanism to update these boundaries in subsequent negotiation rounds based upon the individual negotiation outcomes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that addresses both these requirements and evaluate it using an example scenario for composite service provisioning.

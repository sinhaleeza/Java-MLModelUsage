This paper describes a framework supporting the runtime monitoring of requirements for systems implemented as compositions of Web-services specified in BPEL. The requirements that can be monitored are specified in event calculus. The paper presents an overview of the framework and describes the architecture and implementation of a tool that we have developed to operationalise it. It also presents the results of a preliminary experimental evaluation of the framework.

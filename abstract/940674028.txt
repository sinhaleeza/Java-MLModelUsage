Vehicular communication can enhance the safety and effectiveness of the autonomous vehicle (AV) control process. However, existing AV communication never considers the issues of when to communicate, who to communicate with, and what information to share. We show that the answer to the when, who, and what questions are situation dependent and attempt to define a semantic model to capture a relatively complete set of situations. Based on the semantic model, we define the communication protocols that are best suited to different situations. We then experimentally show that our protocol is efficient and effective.

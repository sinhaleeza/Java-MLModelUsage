To solve the problem of low information integration for heating industry, a framework of information service platform is proposed. The framework realizes information sharing and integration control of central heating. Four core components are designed to implement process development, service collaboration, publish/subscribe and event rule. A heating management system has been designed based on these components, which realizes intelligent and security of the production management. And three application subsystems have been developed to realize heating maintenance service, multi-level alarm service and heating charging service. The information service platform effectively achieves information integration and rapid service development.

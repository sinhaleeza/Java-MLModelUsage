Many techniques have been proposed to transform BPMN into BPEL. The transformation for single BPMN process is studied well. But multiple BPMN processes often suffer from mismatch issues. This paper aims to better transform multiple BPMN processes containing interaction mismatches. The challenges for such transformation are: ensuring transformed BPEL processes compatible; ensuring transformation interaction-preserved, which means keeping interactions those do not cause transformed processes mismatch preserved and transformed. In the paper, interaction mismatches are classified into two categories: static and runtime interaction mismatch. Both of them can be discovered by our approach based on interaction control-flow relations. For better transformation, discovered mismatch interactions are minimized and only the minimized result will not be transformed. A case study is given to illustrate the approach. The transformation also provides general support for transforming cross-organizational business processes into executable processes.

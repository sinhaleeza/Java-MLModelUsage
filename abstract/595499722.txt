Recently, there has been a growing interest in web service composition and the related security issues. In this paper, we propose a framework for the decentralized execution of composite web services capable to ensure the correctness as well as the security of the execution. Our framework relies on a data structure, called container, which is passed among the web services participating in the composition. The container is encrypted and authenticated in such a way to ensure the correctness of the execution flow as well as a set of relevant security requirements.

In this paper we present a model for delivering differentiated quality of service based on the value for the provider. The value for the provider is captured by taking into account the (i) client value, (ii) service value, and certain exogenous factors. We enumerate and articulate different dimensions which will affect these components. We present a couple of case studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model. The first case study is from retail banking based on our real life experience of deploying a service delivery system in a leading bank in India. The second case study is from a business process outsourcing industry. We also define the notion of value plot to visualize the relative importance of customers from value perspective and highlight how the value plot can be used for both operational as well as strategic planning in service delivery.

This paper proposes key requirements and interfaces for the management of life cycle of context-aware and personalized mobile services. The main rationale behind the work presented here is that the service management component should be designed in such as a way that life cycle aspects should emerge from within service management components themselves as an integral part of overall services management. The features of context-aware applications and services should be reflected in life cycle management. Furthermore, standard practices of the mobile network industry must be taken into account for any serious effort to deal with this issue. All these aspects have guided and provided impetus for the work presented. Therefore this work is easily applicable in industry applications and proposes a clear-cut association between requirements and interfaces

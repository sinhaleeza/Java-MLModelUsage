This paper presents an adaptive failure detection service (ALTER), which incorporates the technique of unreliable failure detection service and the idea of R-GMA. ALTER is organized in a hierarchical structure. It can be adaptive to the system conditions and user requirements with changing the system parameters and system organizations. With experimental evaluation, ALTER shows good scalability and flexibility.

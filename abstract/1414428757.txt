Service Assured task execution is an exemplary need for Enterprise Task Crowdsourcing, even when crowdsourcing tasks on open and public crowdosourcing platforms, which are characteristic of non-committed and discretionary task execution by crowd workers. Service Assurance (SA) has broader semantics than SLA fulfillment in the context of enterprise task crowdsourcing, as explained in our previous work on Service Assurance Framework for Enterprise task crowdsourcing. The framework is designed for open crowd platforms and enables to map a given requester SLA to worker SA requirements and select crowd workers who evince high probability of SA requirement fulfillment. Even with these select crowd workers, it might not be possible to implicitly assume the sustenance of workers' expected SA (which is computed based on workers' prior task executions) in the day to day task executions on the Enterprise Requester tasks, owing to the unbinding task execution facilitated by the open crowd platforms. This might result in defaulting in requester SLA fulfillment, rendering the worker selection (by the framework) futile. Hence, in addition to selecting the required SA fulfilling workers, it is essential to employ suitable SA sustaining strategies in place for sustaining the SA expected of workers. The SA Sustaining Strategies and the Service Assurance Framework together constitute for the Service Assurance Sustaining Enterprise Task Crowdsourcing Service (SAS Service)for Enterprise Tasks, which is deliberated in this paper. The SAS Service's performance is validated using appropriate crowd experiments.

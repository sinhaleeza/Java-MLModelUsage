caGrid has accumulated a repository of biomedical services, however, how a cancer researcher can find proper services in the caGrid when needed remains a big challenge. This research aims to enhance the cyber infrastructure of caGrid, by developing a mechanism that turns caGrid services into semantic-aware interoperable services. We proposed a service semantics model, and developed a technique that automatically extracts semantic metadata from static WSDL service descriptions. Such semantic information is stored as loosely coupled annotations that can be queried using semantic Web techniques, to enhance services discovery and composition. We also proposed a two-phase discovery technique that helps users quickly identify interested service operations. This paper also reports our examinations over available techniques and recommends a feasible infrastructure for biomedical service reuse. A prototyping system is developed as a proof of concept.

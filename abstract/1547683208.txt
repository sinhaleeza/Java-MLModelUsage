A Service Oriented Enterprise (SOE) provides an efficient and flexible platform where multiple Web services can cooperate together to provide a value-added service. Change management is one of the fundamental issues in enabling SOEs. In this paper, we propose a framework that facilitates in automatically managing top-down changes in SOEs. We start with formalizing a SOE's schema since it is a central concept for specifying and managing top-down changes in SOEs. We then propose a change model as a guide to react to changes. Algorithms are proposed to implement changes by refining a SOE's behavior.

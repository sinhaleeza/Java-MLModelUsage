This paper proposes a rapid application development framework for creating mobile Web services supported by a dynamic workflow engine that displays an interface depending on a specified workflow. The model leverages on existing reference architectures, and open source standards, to create an interoperable, flexible and easy to implement development framework for creating mobile Web services. Our model is generic in nature to allow the development of Web services for a diverse range of scenarios. The dynamic workflow engine, residing on the client allows for easy updates on the server, and again caters to a diverse set of applications on the client side. The rapid application development model for mobile Web services proposed in this paper has been applied to a field service solution workflow and details on the implementation at both the client and the server are provided.

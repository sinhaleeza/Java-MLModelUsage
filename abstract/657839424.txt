Cloud services are Internet-based XaaS (X as a Service) services, where X can be hardware, software or applications. As Cloud consumers value QoS (Quality of Service), Cloud providers should make certain service level commitments in order to achieve business success. This paper argues for Cloud service negotiation. It outlines a research roadmap, reviews the state of the art, and reports our work on Cloud service negotiation. Three research problems that we formulate are QoS measurement, QoS negotiation, and QoS enforcement. To address QoS measurement, we pioneer a quality model named CLOUDQUAL for Cloud services. To address QoS negotiation, we propose a tradeoff negotiation approach for Cloud services, which can achieve a higher utility. We also give some ideas to solve QoS enforcement, and balance utility and success rate for QoS negotiation.

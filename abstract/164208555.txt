Current QoS-aware automatic service composition queries over a network of web services are often one-time in nature. After a network of web services is built, such queries are issued once, and answers are found from the scratch. The underlying assumption is that the participating web services are rather static, which means that their functional and non-functional parameters seldom change. However, such an assumption is often baseless. New services come and go, service APIs change gradually, and QoS values fluctuate in practice. Therefore, a support for efficiently adapting service composition is desired. In this paper, we propose an event driven continuous query algorithm to intelligently cope with different types of dynamic services, and thus enable evolution of service composition. Evaluation using both real QoS data and synthetic web service data shows its superior performance, compared with the state-of-the-art solution which won the performance championship of Web Service Challenge in 2009 and 2010. Moreover, we generalize a new graph problem: dynamic single-source optimal-Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) problem based on the above work. It is argued that API recommendation for framework evolution, as another typical application, could also be modeled and addressed efficiently using the proposed new graph approach.

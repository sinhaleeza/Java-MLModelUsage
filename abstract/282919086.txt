A significant obstacle to building usable, web-based interfaces for computational science in a Grid environment is how to deploy scientific applications on computational resources and expose these applications as web services. To streamline the development of these interfaces, we propose a new application framework that can deliver user-defined scientific workflows as both web services and OpenSocial gadgets. Through this application framework, scientists can focus on defining computational workflows using domain-specific applications and can use the software tools in the framework to quickly generate gadgets for running the applications and visualizing the output from workflow executions. By assembling these domain-specific gadgets and some common gadgets predefined in the framework for workflow management, scientists can easily set up a customized computational workspace to meet their requirements.

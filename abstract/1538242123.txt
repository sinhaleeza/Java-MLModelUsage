With the development of Internet and Service/Cloud computing, more and more underlying web services are horizontally distributed on geographically distance servers connected with Internet. Inspired by MapReduce, we design a system architecture and Preprune-Refine framework in this paper to handle these distributed web services. Extensive experiments show that our Preprune-Refine framework performs efficiently and effectively and scales well.

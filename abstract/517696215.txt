Orchestration and choreography language provide basic composition techniques and specification among services, but they don't give any secure manners or secure operation styles and specifications. For giving a general guide to implement secure orchestration and choreography, we give a formal approach for carrying out this goal. To this target, we address those by designing an extension of the Spi calculus with secure global calculus. We named our method SpiG4WSC calculus. The combination of strong practical needs for secure Web services composition and the theoretical foundations will lead to a bridge between practice and theories.

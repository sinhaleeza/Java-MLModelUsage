As a communication mean, personal portal which is an entrance where each user can acquire his/her interested information on the network, is often used. We have problems on the existing personal portal described as follows. First, the program to realize the personal portal which is located on a specific Web server, becomes large-scaled and complicated. Because Web pages as personal portal depend on that program, those Web pages can't always be useful for each user equally. Therefore, to solve these problems, we developed two kinds of new Web service which are realized on the network introducing DACS(destination addressing control system) scheme, which is the network management scheme by communication control of client computers. By use of these Web services, each user can create the customized personal portal, which displays the information by a user unit, for using in actual network easily and freely for oneself. In this paper, to deal with information not only by a user unit, but also by a group unit and by all users unit, DACS Web service is proposed. DACS Web service is realized by extending two kinds of functions of Web service respectively and integrating these functions. As the result, each user can create the customized Web page as personal portal, which will be often useful in actual network.

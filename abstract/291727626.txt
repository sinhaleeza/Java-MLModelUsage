The modular datacenter networks (MDCN) comprise inter- and intra-container networks. Although it simplifies the construction and maintenance of mega-datacenters, interconnecting hundreds of containers and supporting online data-intensive services is still challenging. In this paper, we present meGautz, which is the first inter-container network that isolates inter- and intra-container traffic, and it has the following advantages. First, meGautz offers uniform high capacity among servers in the different containers, and balances loads at the container, switch, and server levels. Second, it achieves traffic isolation and allocates bandwidth evenly. Therefore, even under an all-to-all traffic pattern, the inter- and intra-container networks can deal with their own flows without interfering with each other, and both can gain high throughput. meGautz hence improves the performance of both the entire MDCN and individual servers, for there is no performance loss caused by resource competition. Third, meGautz is the first to achieve as graceful performance degradation as computation and storage do. Results from theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that meGautz is a high-capacity, fault-tolerant, and traffic isolated inter-container network.

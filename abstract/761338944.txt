Large and complex workflow repositories include a series of interdependent workflows. In this scenario, it becomes hard to estimate the effort required to accomplish changes to workflows. Furthermore, ad-hoc changes may induce side and ripple effects, which ultimately hamper the reliability of the repository. In this paper, we introduce a static dependency-centric change impact analysis approach for workflow repository management. The approach relies on metrics and visualizations that makes it easy and quick to estimate change impact. We implemented the approach, incorporated it into HP Operations Orchestration (HP OO), and conducted an exploratory study in which we thoroughly analyzed the workflow repository of 8 HP OO customers. Besides being able to characterize and compare the repositories against each other, we found that while the out-of-the-box repository provided by HP OO has 10 flows with high change impact, 5 customer repositories had higher values that ranged from 11 (+10%) to 35 (+250%).

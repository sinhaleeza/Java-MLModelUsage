Online periodic prediction is very common in practical problems like stock index analysis or traffic status estimation, where a prediction service is invoked at every time point. However, due to the potential communication cost, service overheads or the expenditure incurred by every prediction service invocation, it is valuable to reduce the number of invocation times without sacrificing too much precision. Therefore, we present an approach based on reinforcement learning to select the timing for prediction service invocations, which still guarantees high quality in capturing the regularity in a future time series. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world airfare search volume dataset of multiple routes. The experiment results prove that our algorithms show superiority over other solutions.

Coordination is a central problem in distributed computing. The aim is towards flexible coordination, managed at run-time, in open, dynamic environments. This approach would benefit from an explicit common vocabulary for coordination and hence, in a previous paper, we modelled coordination in an ontology, describing the activities carried out and the interdependencies among these activities. The purpose of this paper is to show how such an ontology can be used alongside a set of rules to perform coordination by managing the interdependencies among activities. The ontology and rules can then be used to provide a general purpose coordination tool in the form of a Web service

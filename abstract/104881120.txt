The development of services-based systems starts from defining goals for business processes to be implemented, e.g., as a Web service orchestrations specified in WS-BPEL. In this paper, we propose a scenario-driven approach for modeling business processes. We aim for simplicity in the notation and leverage example-like modeling principles in order to improve process sketching. The first step in our approach is to identify the essential business requirements and model them using a simple scenario notation. The scenarios, given as UML sequence diagrams, are synthesized into a state machine, which is translated into a WS-BPEL flavored process skeleton given as UML activity diagram. The process skeleton can be further refined into executable process model.

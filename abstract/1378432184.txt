Instant messaging systems such as ICQ and Wechat enable interpersonal and pervasive interaction via the communication networks as well as the Internet. Using the same architecture and principles, a specific system called IMAS was developed for trading exhibitions. IMAS supports Android environments, helps to establish and maintain business links, and mediates requirements of visitors and offers of exhibitors. Both visitors and exhibitors can benefit more from the system if they can not only establish contacts and make schedules with each other, but also use and mashup further information services that are provided by the backend systems of different exhibitors. This paper reports on our efforts to extend IMAS with data services and mashups thereof, presents some intermediate progress, and discusses some hard issues encountered during the extension.

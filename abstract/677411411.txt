We propose an approach to leverage the development life cycle of a semantic portal through the use of Object Management Group's model driven architecture (MDA). In our proposed approach, developers can use their prior knowledge about system modeling and UML to create semantic applications, without worrying much about various ontologic intricacies. We believe that our proposed combination of the semantic technologies and MDA-centric standardizations makes an ideal contrivance for the integration and development of standardized knowledge-based applications.

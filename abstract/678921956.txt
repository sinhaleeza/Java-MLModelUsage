With meeting the demand of the higher recall ratio and precision ratio of service discovery, a service migration mechanism is proposed to achieve efficient service search. In this paper, service migration architecture is proposed for realizing semantic annotation and service migration. And an ontology alignment mechanism is proposed for maintaining the consistency of ontology concepts. In order to realize efficient service discovery, an algorithm based on semantic annotation is proposed. The experiments show that our proposed method solves the search problem of low efficiency based on keyword, and it effectively improves the recall ratio and precision ratio of web service discovery.

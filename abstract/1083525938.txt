Contemporary public administrations all over the world are exploring new service provision models that adhere to citizens needs. Recently, the "life-event" concept was introduced as a guiding metaphor for presenting and providing integrated public services. A life-event includes all public services that are related to a specific situation that citizens face. Although the concept of life-events is increasingly important for public administrations, the relevant scientific literature is limited. In this paper we present the main classes of an ontology for modeling life-events. It is anticipated that the use of this ontology will facilitate domain experts in public authorities to model life-events in a straightforward manner.

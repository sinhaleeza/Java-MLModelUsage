Service-oriented software systems (SOSS) are becoming the leading edge of software engineering. SOSS are virtual peer-to-peer networks of autonomous software components behaving like the services in real world mass service systems. As such service-oriented systems have no inherent tool to support business processes. The paper proposes an implementation of business processes in SOSS. The implementation can be improved if data stores can be integrated into SOSS and used together with the classical message passing. It indicates that service orientation is based on a paradigm different from the object-oriented one.

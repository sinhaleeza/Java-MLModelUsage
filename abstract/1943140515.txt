Service selection has been a critical concern for constructing a distributed service-based system. So far, research efforts on service selection are mainly based on the criteria of functionality and QoS (Quality of Service). However, the credit of Web service represents the reputation and importance of a Web service, which also provides a key criterion for selecting service. Then the challenge is how to measure the credit of Web service. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the credit of service through service network. First, we propose a model for constructing exact service network, which is effectively applied to different type of services like WSDL and Web API. Next, an approach is proposed to depict the credit of service from three aspects: popularity, influence and authority. We use about 15000 services from Seekda and ProgrammableWeb in the experiments, the results show that our approach can rank the credit of service effectively, and play a positive role in measuring the credit of a service.

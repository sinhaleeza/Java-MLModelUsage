Nowadays, system and network resource management software should deal with more and more heterogeneous specific interfaces of different resource. This is a tightly-coupled management model. Recent years, Web Services have become the major technology and architecture of SOA for enterprise applications. Web Services provides a loosely-coupled management model. In this paper, based on the Web Services-based management protocol-WSManagement, we propose the distributed System and Network Resource Management Middleware Model. In this model, every managed IT resource provides the manageability interfaces via WS-Management specification. Furthermore, we utilize WSManagement Java implementation prototype-wiseman and WMI management interface to carry out the scheme implementation and test case work of the novel model, and then analyze the experiment results. At last, we analyze the prospective research direction and challenges in this field.

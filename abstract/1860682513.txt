Unlicensed taxis are widely considered as major obstacles to city traffic regulation and public safety. Thus, many governments have issued restrictions for car-hailing services and alleged that the use of unlicensed vehicles was illegal. However, it is very challenging that traffic administrative enforcements face limited manpower to prohibit unlicensed taxis, due to costly and time-consuming procedure of on-site evidence collection. In this paper, we propose an effective service to incorporate human mobility mechanism into unlicensed taxis detection from massive city-wide vehicles. We first extract 276 spatio-temporal features, which are grouped into two categories, including daily behaviors and sustainable behaviors to capture the mobility characteristics of unlicensed taxis. Second, we investigate the detection accuracy of three machine learning techniques, viz. support vector machines, decision tree, and logical regression. We illustrate our approach using real-world vehicle license plate recognition dataset in Xiamen, China, which contains 336 million passing records for 6.2 million vehicles filmed by 439 devices in August 2016. Experimental results reveal that LR outperforms SVM and DT in prediction accuracy and F-score measurement, while SVM is capable of identifying the largest number of unlicensed taxis.

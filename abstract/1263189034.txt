More and more enterprises rely on web services as an important channel for conducing business process and some changes to web services might occur for various reasons, efficiently managing services change becomes crucial. In this paper, we proposes a web service change management framework based on Bayesian Network, which enable representing the inside causal and probabilities semantics of dynamic changes to web services. The framework implement change management effectively in a heuristic way, by analyzing and identifying the detail of change as well as providing some meaningful knowledge to the following reaction. With the continuous evolution of the associated Bayesian Network, the efficiency and applicability of the web service change management network can be improved to a satisfied extent.

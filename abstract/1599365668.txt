The article tackles the problem of conformance checking of communicating resource systems, such as hierarchical distributed systems, Restful Web services, ROA systems, etc. We present a framework, consisting of methods and algorithms, which allows to check whether a system's behavior, as derived from logs, conforms to its ideal model (derived from APIs and specifications). We define several system properties and present how they can be verified using our approach. To express the model formally, as well as minimize representational bias, we introduce RAs process calculus, a formal language specifically designed to model communicating resource systems.

Considering the inherent heterogeneous, autonomous and dynamic nature of Web services, mismatches usually exist between service signatures and behaviors, and mediation is a common approach for service interactions. Current techniques focus on mismatch analysis and automatic synthesis of mediators at development time, but they do not consider the effect that dynamic changes of services bring about for mediators at runtime. Since Web services are continuously evolving, mediators should be equipped with the dynamic adaptation and re-configuration capabilities to avoid being the bottleneck of the adaptability of service interactions. To address this challenge we propose a dynamic management approach for mediated service interactions. In this paper, migration strategies and correctness criteria suitable for the mediator are provided to realize dynamic adjustment of mediators at runtime, which ensures the agility and adaptability of service interactions based on the mediation mechanism.

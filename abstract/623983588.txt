Enterprises are more and more using hybrid cloud environments to deploy and run applications. This consists in providing and managing software and hardware resources within the enterprise and getting additional resources provided externally by public clouds whenever this is needed. In this later case, deployment of new applications consists in choosing a placement of some components in the private cloud and some others in the public cloud. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we have proposed in a previous work an approximate approach based on communication and hosting costs induced by the deployment of components in the public cloud. In this paper, we go further and propose a new efficient algorithm adapted for service-based applications modelled that can be not only described as behavior-based but also as architecture-based compositions of services.

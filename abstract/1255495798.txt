Online relationships in social networks are often based on real world relationships and can therefore be used to infer a level of trust between users. We propose leveraging these relationships to form a dynamic "Social Cloud,‚Äù thereby enabling users to share heterogeneous resources within the context of a social network. In addition, the inherent socially corrective mechanisms (incentives, disincentives) can be used to enable a cloud-based framework for long term sharing with lower privacy concerns and security overheads than are present in traditional cloud environments. Due to the unique nature of the Social Cloud, a social market place is proposed as a means of regulating sharing. The social market is novel, as it uses both social and economic protocols to facilitate trading. This paper defines Social Cloud computing, outlining various aspects of Social Clouds, and demonstrates the approach using a social storage cloud implementation in Facebook.

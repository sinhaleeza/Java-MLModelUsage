BPEL is a popular standard language in SOA enterprise for specifying business process. A developer has to use specific programming technologies to construct process structure and specify Web services inputs and outputs in the process. It is time-consuming to specify every business process from low-level Web services. This paper proposes a semantic extended BPEL model for SOA process generation, and implements the model in a practical BPEL IDE. The new BPEL IDE supports efficient visual design of SOA processes, and helps developers focus more on business logic. A real multimedia conference SOA application is given to demonstrate the efficiency of SOA process generation with semantic extended BPEL model on the new BPEL IDE. And a Load Runner evaluation is given to validate the efficient BPEL process generation has no negative effect on execution efficiency of the generated BPEL code.

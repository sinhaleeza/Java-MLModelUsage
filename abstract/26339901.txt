The rush is on to service-enable everything, and those that fail to capitalize on this trend will be left behind in the marketplace. While new applications can be written for this environment, substantial value exists in legacy applications and systems. Successfully service enabling these applications is not easy for software vendors due to the complexity of integration. To address this problem, we focus on the issue of service specification using models which clearly capture the scope, capability and state of a service. Such models make integration of services more certain and can allow previously incompatible services to be combined more easily. We have prototyped Web2Exchange, a platform for modeling, transforming and integrating services. We have publicly demonstrated the platform by showcasing a "mashup" of the HP Opencall Media platform with web-based calendaring in November of 2008. Since then, we have developed additional services on the platform, and are beginning to make the platform available to others outside of our organization.

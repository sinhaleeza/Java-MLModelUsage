Context-aware service is a new service mode that can provide appropriate service automatically to improve service level based on context information. In context-aware service, service is provided based on the current scene of customer. The scene is identified by context, and scene transition is caused by the change of context. Current research focuses on modeling service with context directly. However, the fact is that the vast majority of context change does not cause the change of scene, and monitoring context to determine the scene directly is inefficient, especially of the multi-context application. We use event which is defined by context as the motivation of scene change and propose an event driven model of context-aware service: EDM. A case of smart home service is discussed to show how to use EDM to do the requirement analysis, design, and implementation of context-aware service. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively reduce the number of scene determination in multi-context application.

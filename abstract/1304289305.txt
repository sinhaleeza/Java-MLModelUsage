Traditional methods for implementing highly resilient systems are costly; and their methods using specialized hardware and high-speed interconnects do not extend to cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;We demonstrate an architecture that rethinks the traditional approach and uses cloud's agility to provision additional capability as failures occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;This architecture continues serving requests with the best possible response even as the primary service deteriorates and even fails completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;It offloads requests according to their need to access the primary service; first redirecting requests with less need to lower-grade secondary capability that is provisioned on-demand on the cloud in order to reserve primary capacity for requests that need it (e.g., first redirect web-browsing requests to a slightly out-of-date cached dataset, and reserve the primary, most-consistent data service for check-out requests).&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach 1) triages access to the primary service based on request needs in times when it is overwhelmed, and 2) provisions on-demand cloud capability to offload and continue serving other requests as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a highly resilient system architecture that scales via cloud.

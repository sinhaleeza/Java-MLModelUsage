The LARIAT system developed at IBM Research uses information extraction applied to news feeds and other time-sensitive documents, along with historical and enterprise data, to provide a stream for B2B sales leads to different sales teams. This paper overviews the system and discusses lessons learned. LARIAT is contrasted with the IBM infoSage system from almost two decades ago. The experience with LARIAT is used as the basis for the design of a Solution-as-a-Service framework that will enable a richly extensible version of the capability, which could serve multiple B2B companies while affording economies of scale.

The concept of containerization and virtualization is getting traction in the cloud based IT environments. Docker engine is popular implementation for simplifying and streamlining containerization technology. IT industry realizes numerous automation and acceleration features and facilities through the embracement of the Docker-sponsored containerization paradigm, which is an operating system (OS)-level and lightweight virtualization. However the security issues affect the widespread and confident usage of Docker platform. In this paper, we have discussed important security issues of the Docker containers as well as the related work that is being carried out in this area. Also we have proposed security algorithms and methods to address DoS attacks related issues in the Docker container technology. The preliminary experiments and testing of the security methods are promising.

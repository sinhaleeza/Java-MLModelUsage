As more and more reusable web services are published on the Internet, how to help users quickly identify appropriate candidate services has become an increasingly critical challenge. Most of the current research efforts on service discovery rely on syntax and semantics-based service matchmaking. In contrast, this paper presents a novel way of applying network routing mechanism to facilitate service discovery, featuring scalability and performance. Services annotated by Web Ontology Language for Services (OWL-S) are organized into a network based on semantic clustering. Virtual routers are created representing clusters, and Bloom Filters are generated for service routing. A service search request is thus transformed into a network routing problem to quickly locate semantic service cluster and in turn to candidate services. In addition, the deterministic annealing technique is applied to facilitate service classification in the network construction. Dynamic network adjustment is operated to ensure the search performance in the network. Empirical study over common testbed annotated in OWL-S is reported.

With the growing popularity of mobile devices, a new type of peer-to-peer communication mode for mobile cloud computing has been introduced. By applying a variety of short-range wireless communication technologies to establish connections with nearby mobile devices, we can construct a mobile cloudlet in which each mobile device can either works as a computing service provider or a service requester. Although the paradigm of mobile cloudlet is cost-efficient in handling computation-intensive tasks, the understanding of its corresponding service mode from a theoretic perspective is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first propose a new mobile cloudlet-assisted service mode named Opportunistic task Scheduling over Co-located Clouds (OSCC), which achieves flexible cost-delay tradeoffs between conventional remote cloud service mode and mobile cloudlets service mode. Then, we perform detailed analytic studies for OSCC mode, and solve the energy minimization problem by compromising among remote cloud mode, mobile cloudlets mode and OSCC mode. We also conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed OSCC mode, and analyze its applicability. Moreover, experimental results show that when the ratio of data size after task execution over original data size associated with the task is smaller than 1 (i.e.,

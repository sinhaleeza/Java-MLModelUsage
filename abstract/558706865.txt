Service discovery is one of the key problems that have been widely researched in the area of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based systems. Web Service clustering is a technique for efficiently facilitating service discovery. Most Web Service clustering approaches are based on suitable semantic similarity distance measure and a threshold. Threshold selection is essentially difficult and often leads to unsatisfactory accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed a self-organizing based clustering algorithm called Taxonomic clustering for taxonomically organizing semantic Web Service advertisements. We have tested the algorithm on both simulation based randomly generated test data and the standard OWL-S TC test data set. We have observed promising results both in terms of accuracy and performance.

In this paper, we describe our work in progress on Web services recommendation for services composition in a Mashup environment, by proposing a new approach to assist end-users based social interactions capture and analysis. This approach uses an implicit social graph inferred from the common composition interests of users. We describe the transformation of users-services interactions into a social graph and a possible means to leverage that graph to derive service recommendation. As this work is in progress, this proposal was implemented within a platform called SoCo where preliminary experiments show interesting results.

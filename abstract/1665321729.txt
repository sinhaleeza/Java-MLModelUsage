Identity management is a central point to the security of large applications such cloud services. The identity providers (IdPs) offer services that handle critical information of users. Usually, this kind of information is stored with special care in these providers and intrusions do not necessarily result in security violations. But intrusions may implant malicious behaviors which modify the action of these authentication services. In this way, unauthorized accesses may be achieved for denying accesses to legitimate users of the system. In this paper we introduce an approach for intrusion tolerance to ensure the correct behavior in authentication of large systems, even in presence of possible intrusions.

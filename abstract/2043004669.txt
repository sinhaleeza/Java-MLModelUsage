Time is an important parameter in modeling and analyzing Web services. A Web service can be presented by its behavior which can be described by a business protocol representing the possible sequences of message exchanges. Automated analyses of timed Web services such as compatibility checking are very difficult and in some cases are not possible with the presence of implicit transitions (internal transitions) based on time constraints. The semantics of the implicit transitions is the source of this difficulty because most of well known modeling tools do not express this semantics (e.g., epsilon transition on the timed automata has a different semantics). This paper presents an approach for removing complex implicit transitions of the timed business protocols before performing the interoperability analysis without changing the semantics of the protocols.

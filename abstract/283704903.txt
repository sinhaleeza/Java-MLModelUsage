Traditionally, the composition of Web services to create mashups has been achieved by using an application server as a mediator between a client browser and services. To avoid this bottleneck, mashups are sometimes implemented so that Web service composition takes place directly from the end userpsilas browser. Creating such implementations is difficult because developers must manage the separation of software into various distributable pieces, in different languages, and coordinate their communication. In this paper we describe a middleware for managing Web service mashups in a disciplined, and flexible way. We build upon the established abstraction of XML pipelines, but describe a new approach for selectively partitioning pipeline components between a browser client and application server. We provide a performance evaluation for a common mashup application scenario.

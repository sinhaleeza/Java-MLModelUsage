In this paper we measured and analyzed the workload on Yahoo! Video, the 2nd largest U.S. video sharing site, to understand its nature and the impact on online video data center design. We discovered interesting statistical properties on both static and temporal dimensions of the workload; they include file duration and popularity distributions, arrival rate dynamics and predictability, and workload stationarity and burstiness. Complemented with queueing-theoretic techniques, we extended our understanding on the measurement data with a virtual data center design assuming the same workload as measured, which reveals results regarding the impact of workload arrival distribution, service level agreements (SLAs) and workload scheduling schemes on the design and operations of such large-scale video distribution systems.

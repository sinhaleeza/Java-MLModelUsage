This panel aims to explore the intrinsic and multi-facet relationships between software and services and the effects of such relationships on the coupling and transformation of computing and business and the embedding of service oriented architecture (SOA) into future computing and business management environments. Today, more and more software are augmented with service oriented packaging. At the same time, more and more business and government services are provided and offered in the form of software. The key focus of this panel is to discuss and debate: (1) Where software and services will meet? (2) Can and how the dynamic and multi-facet relationships between software and services are modeled and exploited? (3) What can be leveraged in this endeavor from the perspective of Web services, business transformation, and consumer demand?

Computational grids provide significant computing power by sharing resources across administrative domains. In secure environment the performance of girds arrives at maximization. For this purpose we propose a distributed secure structure which emphasis communication of hosts and active security issues in a grid. We also discuss the fault tolerance and recovery mechanism for enhancing system reliability.

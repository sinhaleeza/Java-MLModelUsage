The composition of multiple services that are deployed on smart devices generally incurs significant communication overheads, especially when an optimized composition is pursued. A parallel approach for service composition is proposed for obtaining the optimal solution with minimum executing time efficiently. In this approach, the request for a composite service is represented by a function graph which is decomposed into multiple path-structured sub graphs firstly. Then messages are sent among the service nodes to search for the corresponding sub-solutions. Finally, a Branch-and-Bound strategy is applied to generate the optimal solution over these sub-solutions. The experiments show our optimization strategies can reduce the time and communication cost considerably under different experimental settings.

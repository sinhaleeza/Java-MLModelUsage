Though there are some existing data service mashup tools, it is still challenging for novice end users to develop data service mashup to solve data query problem in the situational and ad-hoc business scenario. This paper focuses on the problem of recommending data service mashup plans under the condition that 1) the mashup plan cannot be determined in advance and 2) user simple request description. In our approach, some keywords are allowed as input and then the Top-K data service mashup plans are generated as output. This paper analyzes the problem with a motivating scenario, introduces the core definitions and proposes an approach to creating data service mashup plans. Inspired by the idea of keyword query in structured data, the ACOQT algorithm for generating Top-K data service composition sequence is proposed. Based on the data service and data service operator model defined, the method of configuration data service operator is presented. Experiment results show that the approach of data service mashup plan creation is effective.

To solve the difficulties of the service operators on how to manage services and achieve a continuable operation goal, we propose and develop the 4th party service platform. We also develop a rule-based customizable charge service management component for the platform. The website www.foode.cn is the demonstration. The charging service is used to charge for the 3rd services such as search services, electronic authentication services, online communication services, online payment services and so on. The results show that the 4th party service platform can greatly shorten the construction time of a business application, reduce construction and operating costs, and enable service providers to share in the financial rewards properly.

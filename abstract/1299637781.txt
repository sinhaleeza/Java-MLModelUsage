Many are anticipating that grid computing infrastructure, utilities and services will become an integral part of future socio-economical fabric. However, factors such as cost of access, reliability and dependability of the technology undoubtedly influence its adoption and widespread use. IBM are promoting autonomic computing as a solution to alleviate such concerns by delegating software systems' management, security, reliability and performance tuning to the software itself. Based on an on-going research work, focusing on high-assurance concerns of widely distributed systems, this paper outlines a service-oriented approach and associated service infrastructure description languages, which are used to facilitate the construction and management of ad-hoc federated software services.

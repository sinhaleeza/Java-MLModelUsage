Chip multi-processors (CMPs), commonly referred to as multi-core processors, are being widely adopted for deployment as part of the grid infrastructure. In CMPs, multiple cores can independently execute different threads. This change in computer architecture requires corresponding design modifications in programming paradigms, including grid middleware tools, to harness the opportunities presented by multi- core processors. Simple and naive implementations of grid middleware on multi-core systems can severely impact performance. The goal of developing an optimized multi-threaded grid middleware for emerging multi-core processors will be realized only if researchers and developers have access to an in-depth analysis of the impact of several low level microarchitectural parameters on performance. None of the current grid simulators and emulators provides feedback at the micro-architectural level. We have designed an emulation framework, Multi-core Grid (McGrid), to analyze and provide insightful feedback on the performance limitations, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities for grid middleware on multi-core systems.

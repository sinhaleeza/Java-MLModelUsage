With the increasing number of web services, there appear more and more services with similar functionality but different Quality of Services (QoS) or trust properties. With the emergence user behavior, the requests provided by users may not only contain non-functional properties (NFPs) as their preferences. Moreover, they may also pay attention to trust. To the best of our knowledge, there appears non previous work together consider the above two factors during service selection. Therefore, integrating trust with preference arises as a new challenge for Web service selection. In our previous work [1], [2], we perform web service selection based on user preferences, including qualitative preferences and quantitative preferences. In this paper, we further extend our work and propose a novel multi-objective optimization approach that integrate trust with user preferences to rank the relevancy of web service. Experimental results conducted on open data-sets demonstrate our high-quality service selection results.

This paper presents our design and development of a context-driven content adaptation planner, which dynamically transforms requested Web content into a proper format conforming to receiving contexts (e.g., access condition, network connection, and receiving device). Aiming to establish a semantic foundation for content adaptation, we apply description logics (DLs) to formally define context profiles and requirements and automate content adaptation decision. In addition, the computational overhead caused by content adaptation can be moderately decreased through the reduction of the size of adapted content.

Enterprise modeling using data dependencies is common in monitoring and business performance management systems. The modern enterprise is a dynamic creature, constantly adapting itself to the changing environment. This adaptation may result in changes in enterprise components and data dependencies between them. An enterprise model must be able to express this dynamism, and business performance management services must be able to react accordingly. In this paper, we briefly introduce ADI (active dependency integration technology), a language for modeling data dependencies between entities. We discuss developments related to support in modeling dynamic environments, where elements may be added or deleted. Dynamism-related developments include the support of automatic dependency instantiation from an abstract dependency. The abstract dependency expresses a general pattern in the ontology, functioning as a template for dependency instances. Another aspect of dynamism is support for changes in existing dependencies rather than only creating new dependencies; for example, adding a new entity to a dependency. Changes in topology do not imply system redeployment. ADI also supports the influence of dynamism on data items and subsequent propagation of this influence through the model.

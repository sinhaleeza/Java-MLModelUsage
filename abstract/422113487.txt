In this paper we present a Smart Push system with feedback enabled flow control suitable for web enabled mobile and IoT devices. Our push architecture incorporates a gateway client and gateway server component. The flow of the web push notifications is controlled so that they are delivered to the device when the user is most likely to open them. We present an overview and implementation details of the Smart Push system with enhanced web push features, and describe the algorithm running on the gateway server to enable the push flow control. This architecture also provides flexibility for users to move seamlessly across different geographies and mobile operating systems like Android and Tizen without any changes at the content provider's applications servers. We also present results of an experiment performed on multiple users to measure the effectiveness of the system to perform flow control of the notifications to ensure that more of them are clicked.

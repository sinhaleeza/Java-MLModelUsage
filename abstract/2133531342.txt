This paper describes Navdriver, a novel Software-as-a-Service technology capable of automatically inserting hyperlinks on subscribers' Web pages. Its functionality leverages hotlink assignment algorithms which have been a subject of study in the last decade. The focus of this paper is on describing the underpinnings of Navdriver from the point of view of its SaaS architecture and its interaction with subscribers' Web sites and their pages' visitors. The paper also presents lessons learned over the past five years since Navdriver was officially launched and deployed in live production websites. Navdriver is freely available and supports the most predominant Web browsers and Web technologies.

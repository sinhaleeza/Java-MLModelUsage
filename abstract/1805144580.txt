IT service providers use applications to support their business processes. The need for specialized IT management functionality and information generates a multitude and diversity of management applications that can be recognized in one IT provider's scenario. To run IT and to provide IT services effectively and efficiently, management applications have to be integrated along operational processes. This article introduces an approach to integrate management applications by leveraging a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Therefore, a sufficient understanding of IT service provider's processes and cooperative roles is essential. The presented SOA defines how to integrate management applications loosely coupled in a process-oriented manner, bridging the gap between operational processes and management applications.

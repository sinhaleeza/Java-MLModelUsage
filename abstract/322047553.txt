Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS) aims to not only recommend services similar to those already rated with the highest score, but also provide opportunities for exploring the important role of temporal, spatial and social contexts for personalized web services recommendation. A key step for temporal-based CARS methods is to explore the time decay process of past invocation records to make the Quality of Services (QoS) prediction. However, it is a nontrivial task to model the temporal effects on web services recommendation, due to the dynamic features of contextual information in view of temporal spatial correlations. For instance, in location-aware services recommendation, the user's geographical position would change very frequently as time goes on. In this paper, we propose a Context-Aware Services Recommendation based on Temporal Effectiveness (CASR-TE) method. Inspired by existing time decay approaches, we first present an enhanced temporal decay model combining the time decay function with traditional similarity measurement methods. Then, we model temporal spatial correlations as well as their impacts on the user preference expansion. Finally, we evaluate the CASR-TE method on WS-Dream dataset by evaluation matrices of both RMSE and MAE. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms several benchmark methods with a significant margin.

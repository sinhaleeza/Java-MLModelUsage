Key-word based researches of service discovery focus on direct match of userpsilas requirements and often neglect relations between services. While techniques based on conventional semantic offer many kinds of relations, considerable time is spent on reasoning. In this paper, we utilizes E-FCM (Element Fuzzy Cognitive Map) to describe services for the reason that E-FCM can keep the semantic information as much as possible and E-FCMs can be automatically created for web services. Furthermore, instead of reasoning, the semantic relations among E-FCM are built based on computation, therefore semantic relations among services can be found out quickly. We focus on the associated semantic relations among services because complex applications always comprise of services with associated functions. The associated link network (ALN) is constructed upon associated relations to generate associated web service flows, which can be used to create complex applications, thus to facilitate discovery efficiency and improve utilization of services.

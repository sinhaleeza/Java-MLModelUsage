The semantic Web and Web services technologies have provided both new possibilities and challenges to automatic information processing. There are a lot of researches on applying these new technologies to current personal Web information retrieval systems, but no research addresses the semantic issues from the whole life cycle and architecture point of view. Web services provide a new way for accessing Web resources, but until now, they have been managed separately from conventional Web contents resources. In this paper, we point out new system requirements and propose a conceptual architecture for a personal semantic Web information retrieval system. It incorporates semantic Web, Web sendees, and multiagent technologies to enable not only precise location of Web resources but also the automatic or semiautomatic integration of hybrid Web contents and Web service resources.

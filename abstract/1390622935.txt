With the increasing popularity of web services on the Internet, service selection has become an important issue in large-scale web service systems. In recent years, with the growing energy consumption associated with IT systems and services, energy efficiency has drawn extensive attention in service allocation and selection. However, existing approaches for energy efficient web service selection face great challenges, because of the high dynamics and unpredictability of task arrivals, and large scale of current web service systems. In this paper, we present a distributed online approach for web service selection that jointly considers the conflicting performance metrics including response time, queue congestion and energy consumption. Targeting at optimizing the long-term average system reward, our approach does not require any priori knowledge of the statistics or prediction on task arrivals. Mathematical analysis as well as simulation experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing energy efficiency while stabilizing the system.

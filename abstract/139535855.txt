Despite the large number of software tools and hardware platforms aiming to solve the problems that bioinformatics is facing today, there is no platform solution that can scale up to its demands, in terms of both scope and sheer volume. DiscoveryNet scientific workflow system is here extended into a service-centric component architecture that brings together cross-domain applications through Web and grid services and composes them as novel service offerings. Two case studies implemented on top of the platform, SARS analysis and microarray/metabonomics, are described.

This paper introduces an automatic Web service composition method based on logical inference of Horn clauses in Petri net models. The available services and user request described in SA WSDL are translated into a set of Horn clauses and the composability rules of the services' input/output parameters are established using ontology reasoning. We choose Petri net as the model of this set of Horn clauses. T-invariant method of Petri nets is used to determine the existence of composite Web services that can fulfill user's requirement.

Although significant advances have been seen in service oriented architecture (SOA) experiences. In practice the adoption of SOA at enterprise level is a long-term and complex transformation process. The research on how to extend SOA into an organizational context is still rare. In this paper, model-driven development methodology and platform is presented to handle the complexity of transforming an enterprise into a Service-Oriented Enterprise (SOE). The reference architecture and implementation guide for SOE is described in the methodology. The model-driven platform provides the integrated development and operational environment for SOE. Based on the platform, a total solution for SOE is given which can implement on-demand business.

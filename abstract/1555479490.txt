Implementation and modification of non-functional properties related to monitoring quality of service (QoS) can be both a expensive and complex task. This paper presents a model-based approach to the implementation of QoS monitors by describing them as platform-independent models. Then, model-driven development (MDD) transformations are conducted to create both a system implementation and QoS constraints in the form of aspects according to the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm. Aspects are weaved within the system implementation.

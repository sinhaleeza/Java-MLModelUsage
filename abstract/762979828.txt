Workflow is an important part of service grid. It provides a mechanism to describe the various interactions between services, and it can compose new services out of existing ones dynamically. Grid workflow description language is the basis of the establishment and execution of workflows. In this paper, being extended according to the characteristics of grid environment and applications, a new grid workflow description language called GPEL (grid process execution language) is proposed based on the Web service composition language BPEL4WS.

This article presents a theoretical framework distinguishing four systematically different levels of Web service technology adoption. Based on Swanson's IS innovation theory the conjecture is made that each level of Web service technology adoption has important differences in adoption requirements and the potential outcomes. The framework is intended to be a conceptual basis for methods to evaluate Web service technology adoption and may consequently help devise strategies to effectively adopt Web service technology.

Managing security risks on information systems is essential to guarantee their security while handling costs. However, the complexity of risk assessments is greatly increased when data is spread on multiple environments. In this paper we present a security risk assessment model for distributing business processes in a multi-cloud environment. We aim at offering the full power of cloud computing to composite applications while shielding companies from the complexity related to security risk assessments in the Cloud. We also want to give them the capability to automatically generate secure and cost-effective applications across multiple clouds. Our approach is based on existing risk assessment methodologies, while using the industry recognized IT standards.

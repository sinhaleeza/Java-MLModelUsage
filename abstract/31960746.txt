We present our experiences in building and deploying a text mining solution in services industry settings, specifically in contact centers. We describe the voice of customer (VoC) and customer satisfaction (C-Sat) analysis settings and outline several unique research challenges brought about by this confluence of text mining and industrial services research. We describe our system for integrated text classification, business intelligence and interactive text labeling for C-Sat analysis. We recount invaluable lessons learned as computer science researchers in services research engagements. The system has been deployed in multiple accounts in contact centers and can be extended to any industrial CRM service practice to analyze unstructured text data.

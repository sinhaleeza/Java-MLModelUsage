The number of community detection algorithms is growing continuously adopting a topological based approach to discover optimal subgraphs or communities. In this paper, we propose a new method combining both topology and semantic to evaluate and rank community detection algorithms. To achieve this goal we consider a probabilistic topic based approach to define a new measure called semantic divergence of communities. Combining this measure with others related to prior knowledge, we compute a score for each algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of its communities and propose a ranking method. We have evaluated our approach considering communities of real web services.

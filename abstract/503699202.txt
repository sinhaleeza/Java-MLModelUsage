In recent years, some researchers have begun to focus on researching CDN-P2P-hybrid architecture, but most hybrid architectures belong to tightly-coupled hybrid model. Cloud computing era calls for a more open content service mode. In order to construct open service relationship, we propose one novel CDN-P2P loosely-coupled SLA negotiation model. CDN firstly needs to provide an open and standard-based agreement interface for the P2P and other applications to negotiate with it. Therefore, we use Web Services Agreement Specification (WS-Agreement) for establishing agreement between two CDN and P2P. This scheme also allows CDN easily integrated with other application. The loosely-coupled CDN-P2P-SLA establishment needs to link with SLA performance monitoring, we design WSDM based CDN-P2P loosely coupled SLA monitoring scheme. The prototype system experiments have proved the feasibility of this model and scheme. Finally, we conclude this paper and analyze the prospective research direction.

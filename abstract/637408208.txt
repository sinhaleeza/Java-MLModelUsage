WS-BPEL processes can facilitate service discovery when the services have multiple interfaces in certain order. Current approaches derive the abstract WS-BPEL processes directly from the corresponding executable ones by hiding or omitting the internal activities. However, these simple approaches may prevent the services from being found by valuable potential partners at service discovery stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to refactoring the executable and abstract WS-BPEL processes for service discovery. We show the application of our approach through a typical travel agency service.

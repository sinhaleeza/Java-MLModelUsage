With the development of mobile network and corresponding techniques, more and more works focus on providing efficient services based on mobile devices. Furthermore, motivated by IoT, studies of local distributed mobile devices attract attentions of both industry and academia in recent years. However, existing storage systems cannot manage data and support the QoS of mobile services well. This paper presents LKSM, a light weight key-value storage system, which can be deployed on either one node or multiple nodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose key-value store in this scenario. We carefully analyze the challenges when designing the system on mobile cluster, and further propose RDS for addressing. With the help of RDS, LKSM achieves the goal of lower latency, better scalability, and higher availability. We organize LKSM using a log-structured merge-tree, and implement it based on LevelDB, an open source key-value storage system proposed by Google. Experiments on physical smartphones demonstrate that LKSM presents much higher performance compared with the ported LevelDB on mobile devices.

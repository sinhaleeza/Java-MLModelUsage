DataGrids are becoming increasingly important for sharing large data collections, achievements and resources. The BSP model is a widely used parallel programming model. The idea of the superstep in the BSP model should be able to help DataGrid access and storage in regular sequence. When services are not isolated from each other in multiuser environments, this should be able to avoid, in the process of data access and storage, the occurrence of four types or phenomena: lost update, dirty read, nonrepeatable read, phantom.

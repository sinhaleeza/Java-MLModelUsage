Monitoring is the cornerstone for cloud service management, so it is significant for a cloud monitoring tool to support customization for specific monitoring requirements, to indicate the correlation between target services, and to guide adaptive service management. Unfortunately, traditional monitoring tools are always developed independently with service management platforms and are provided as self-contained softwares, which limit their capabilities on addressing these requirements. In this paper, we propose MonValley, an unified monitoring and management framework for cloud services. It consists of four components: 1) a high-level language for practitioners to express monitoring specifications on the services from all three layers, 2) a compiler to translate the expressive program into an executable program, 3) an execution engine to execute the executable program, 4) a runtime to provide supports on basic functionalities, such as data transmission. MonValley provides an innovative approach to facilitate the integrated monitoring and adaptive management for cloud services.

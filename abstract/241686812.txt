Video-on-demand (VoD) services historically rely on commercial content distribution networks (CDNs) for on-demand capacity provisioning. Content providers gradually prefer a self-managed content infrastructure because of its full control and customization. However, such a dedicated physical infrastructure could be costly in initial capital investment, and complex in management. It has become a promising alternative to host VoD services on pay-as-you-go cloud platforms, on which using dynamic server provisioning to reduce server rental cost is the key objective of content providers. In this paper we address two major challenges to reducing cost: to minimize content reorganization and to tolerate imperfect workload prediction. We first present a practical VoD servicing system design based on a pay-as-you-go cloud. We prove that previous works, focusing exclusively on cost savings, cause significant content reorganization and are vulnerable to imperfect workload prediction. To address such issues, we propose a novel idea called workload absorber, and design a provisioning algorithm called Absorb Window based on the idea. Workload absorbers eliminate the bandwidth wastage and significantly reduce content reorganization. We conduct extensive evaluations with real VoD access traces, and demonstrate the superior scalability of the proposed algorithm by producing highly optimized provisioning in seconds for thousands of servers.

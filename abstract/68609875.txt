One of the main issues in service collaborations among business partners is the possible lack of trust among them. A promising approach to cope with this issue is leveraging on blockchain technology by encoding with smart contracts the business process workflow. This brings the benefits of trust decentralization, transparency, and accountability of the service composition process. However, data in the blockchain are public, implying thus serious consequences on confidentiality and privacy. Moreover, smart contracts can access data outside the blockchain only through Oracles, which might pose new confidentiality risks if no assumptions are made on their trustworthiness. For these reasons, in this paper, we are interested in investigating how to ensure data confidentiality during business process execution on blockchain even in the presence of an untrusted Oracle.

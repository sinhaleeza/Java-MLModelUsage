A cloud mashup is composed of multiple services with shared datasets and integrated functionalities. For example, the elastic compute cloud (EC2) provided by Amazon Web Service (AWS), the authentication and authorization services provided by Facebook, and the Map service provided by Google can all be mashed up to deliver real-time, personalized driving route recommendation service. To discover qualified services and compose them with guaranteed quality of service (QoS), we propose an integrated skyline query processing method for building up cloud mashup applications. We use a similarity test to achieve optimal localized skyline. This mashup method scales well with the growing number of cloud sites involved in the mashup applications. Faster skyline selection, reduced composition time, dataset sharing, and resources integration assure the QoS over multiple clouds. We experiment with the quality of Web service (QWS) benchmark over 10,000 Web services along six QoS dimensions. By utilizing block-elimination, data-space partitioning, and service similarity pruning, the skyline process is shortened by three times, when compared with two state-of-the-art methods.

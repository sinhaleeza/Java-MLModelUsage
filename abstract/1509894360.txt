This special issue includes four extended versions of selected papers originally presented at the IEEE Asia Pacific Services Computing Conference held in Yilan, Taiwan. The papers selected for this issue not only contribute valuable insights and results, but also have particular relevance to services composition, services management, services query, and scheduling for cloud, grid, and pervasive systems. They all present high quality results for tackling problems arising from the ever-growing fields of services and cloud computing. These are briefly reviewed.

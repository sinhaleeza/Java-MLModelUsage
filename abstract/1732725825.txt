In recent years, service-oriented computing has been successfully adopted by the industry and used in numerous projects. This raises however new challenges, especially with respect to service selection and ranking in dynamic environments. Selection and ranking are mostly based on first-order predicates and comparison functions, expressed in the consumer side. Such approaches suffer from several shortcomings. The expression language is too complex for most non-technical persons and yet not powerful enough to capture external information, which limits the use of contextual information. Also, current solutions lack flexibility to handle dynamic environments. This paper proposes to integrate algorithms based on the Formal Concept Analysis theory to extend service-oriented component models. The resulting framework externalizes service selection and ranking. Results are integrated in the Apache Felix iPOJO component model.

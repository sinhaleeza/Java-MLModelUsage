Composite service evolution is one of the most important challenges to deal with in the field of service composition. In particular, this paper presents, LiveMig, an approach to live migration of composite service instance, which is a critical step for online composite service evolution. In LiveMig, a set of change operations preserving soundness is first defined. Second, a live instance state migration algorithm is proposed to determine if the state migration is allowed or not, and to compute the exact state after the migration. Finally, the correctness of LiveMig is theoretically proved, and an extensive set of simulations are performed to show its feasibility and effectiveness.

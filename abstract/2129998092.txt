Quality-of-Service (QoS) is widely employed for describing non-functional characteristics of Web services. Although QoS of Web services has been investigated in a lot of previous works, there is a lack of real-world Web service QoS datasets for validating new QoS based techniques and models of Web services. To study the performance of real-world Web services as well as provide reusable research datasets for promoting the research of QoS-driven Web services, we conduct several large-scale evaluations on real-world Web services. Firstly, addresses of 21,358 Web services are obtained from the Internet. Then, invocation failure probability performance of 150 Web services is assessed by 100 distributed service users. After that, response time and throughput performance of 5,825 Web services are evaluated by 339 distributed service users. Detailed experimental results are presented in this paper and comprehensive Web service QoS datasets are publicly released for future research.

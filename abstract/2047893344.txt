Dynamic composition is a key feature of service-oriented computing (SOC) where services are discovered and composed at runtime. Current standards and methods for service compositions require statically binding published WSDL interfaces into compositions in BPEL. In this paper, we present our early result of a framework for dynamic composition on enterprise service bus (ESB). We present the design and implementation of Dynamic Composition Handler.

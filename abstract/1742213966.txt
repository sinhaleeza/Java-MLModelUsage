Runtime monitoring of Web service compositions with WS-BPEL has been widely acknowledged as a significant approach to understand and guarantee the quality of services. However, most existing monitoring technologies only track patterns related to the execution of an individual process. As a result, the possible inconsistency failure caused by implicit interactions among concurrent process instances cannot be detected. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach to specify the behavior properties related to shared resources for web service compositions and verify their consistency with the aid of a parametric stateful aspect extension to WS-BPEL. Parameters are introduced in pattern specification, which allows monitoring not only events but also their values bound to the parameters at runtime to keep track of data flow among concurrent process instances. An efficient implementation is also provided to reduce the runtime overhead of monitoring and event observation. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is promising.

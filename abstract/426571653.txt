In this paper, we propose a dynamic service discovery framework from Web services representation chain. The major components include Web service chains precategorizing module, service exploration engine, services container, chain change detection module with associated control parameters. From the working research prototype, our proposed mechanism enables businesses to easily retrieve up-to-date Web services linked and nested multi-level deep in the service description documents. In addition, a federated Web services discovery portal is illustrated to show how the research results are aggregated from hyperlinked WSIL documents as well as UDDl registries for achieving more accurate services exploration result.

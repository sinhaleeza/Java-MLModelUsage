In mobile web conferencing, slide decks should be optimized before delivery to meet the constraints and environments of target mobile devices. To deliver optimally adapted slides, a trade-off between the visual aspect and delivery time must be reached. Static adaptation methods are CPU-intensive, and require large storage space. The dynamic approach is attractive as the optimal version is created on the fly when the actual slide is to be shared. Existing dynamic solutions are optimized for the resolution of the target mobile device and use good visual quality settings. However, they do not control the resulting data size, which creates serious usability issues, such as increasing the delivery time. Prediction-based methods require much less memory and processing resources than static approaches while yielding an excellent user experience. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective dynamic content adaptation framework, in which we maximize the visual quality and minimize the delivery time simultaneously. We compare our solution with an ideal optimal point, called utopia, and with all the optimal solutions (Pareto front) provided by a static exhaustive system. The obtained results show that our framework yields solutions very close to the utopia and, for the majority of the documents tested, the obtained solutions are on the Pareto front.

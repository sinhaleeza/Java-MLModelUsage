Redundancy-based fault tolerance strategies are proposed for building reliable Service-Oriented Architectures/Applications (SOA), which are usually developed on the unpredictable remote Web services. This paper proposes and implements a distributed replication strategy evaluation and selection framework for fault tolerant Web services. Based on this framework, we provide a systematic comparison of various replication strategies by theoretical formula and real-world experiments. Moreover, a user participated strategy selection algorithm is designed and verified. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the advantage of this framework. In these experiments, users from six different locations all over the world perform evaluation of Web services distributed in six countries. Over 1,000,000 test cases are executed in a collaborative manner and detailed results are also provided.

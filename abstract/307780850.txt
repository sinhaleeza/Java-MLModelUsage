The seamless integration of software applications supporting business activities and field devices belonging to the plant floor is one of the great challenges of the IT world. This requires to build Internet scale distributed systems in complex, heterogeneous environments characterized by stringent requirements regarding security and evolution. In this paper, we argue that software engineering tools are needed in order to facilitate the work of application developers. This paper presents a model-driven engineering approach for the development of a specific tool, dedicated to the development of industrial services for power distribution industry

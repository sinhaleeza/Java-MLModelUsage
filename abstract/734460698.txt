During their lifecycle, business processes are keen to change. Changes either concern the process model structure or the accompanying rules, e.g. Compliance rules (laws and regulations). In the context of business process collaborations, several process partners collaborate together, and changing one process might result in knock-on effects on the other processes, i.e., Change propagation. Since business processes are often subject to restrictions that stem from laws, regulations or guidelines, i.e., Compliance rules, changing them might lead to the violations of these rules (non-compliability). So far, only the impacts of process changes in choreographies have been studied. In this work, we propose an approach that analyzes and evaluates the impacts of process changes on the different compliance rules and inversely, the impacts of compliance rule changes on the process choreography.

In order to loose the tight relationship between management system and the managed IT resources, applying SOA in the system a resource management field is a promising way, as web service can increase the interoperability among multiple resources, application and systems. WS-Management is a general Web Services-based protocol for managing system and network resources. Wiseman is an open source project which implements the WS-Management specification. The paper presents three new test evaluation schemes for WS-Management Protocol and its Implementation project-Wiseman, including JMeter &amp; JProbe based Semi-automatic Test Scheme, Grinder &amp; JProbe based Automatic Test Scheme, and Wiseman and WMI Based Test Scheme. The test experiments have verified that WS-Management shows good functionality and moderate performance. After that, we present our two improvement contribution points to the Wiseman project. Finally, we conclude this paper and analyze the prospective research direction.

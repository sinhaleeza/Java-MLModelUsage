In this paper, the user experience in added value location-based mobile music service called the City Night Life (CNL) is evaluated and analyzed. The CNL service provides recommendations about entertainment premises in the proximity by matching their music styles with the user's personal music preferences. Entertainment premises are shown on a map interface and are marked with colors according to their match. The paper presents the components of the CNL service, the music profile, matching algorithm and the map-based user interface in a web browser. The user evaluation with 53 test users assessed the feasibility and business potential of the CNL service. Data was collected with both quantitative questionnaires and short interviews. The results indicate that the CNL service will be most useful in relatively large, unfamiliar cities. Furthermore, the matching algorithm was perceived to perform quite well.

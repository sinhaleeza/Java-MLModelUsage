In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge resources have become the most valuable assets for enterprises. To better understand and reuse knowledge, it is necessary to relate it with the context in which the knowledge is generated and used. This is a process that usually occurs in an experienced knowledge-worker's mind and without efficient supporting tools. This paper proposes an approach for the acquisition and utilization of context for the enhancement of knowledge and with a particular focus on methods to enable context extraction from industrial settings. The approach adopts a knowledge context ontology, to correlate knowledge and its context in the high-level activities of a knowledge worker. Knowledge context are extracted by utilizing a combination of methods including context identification, context reasoning, and context similarity measurement. Based on the proposed approach, a set of services for context aware knowledge enhancement are developed and applied in The Chinese Enterprise Management Tank (CEMT), a knowledge sharing and reusing platform for business management knowledge workers in all around China.

This paper introduces a service selection model with the service location considered. The location of a service represents its position in the network, which determines the transmission cost of calling this service in the composite service. The more concentrated the invoking services are, the less transmission time the composite service costs. On the other hand, the more and more popular big data processing services, which need to transfer mass data as input, make the effect much more obvious than ever before. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce service location as a basic feature in service selection. The definition and membership functions of service location are presented in this paper. After that, the optimal service selection problem is represented as an optimization problem under some reasonable assumptions. A shortest-path based algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization problem. At last, the case of railway detection is studied for better understanding of our model.

The paper presents work-in-progress on the cloud service provisioning across multiple cloud providers. The work assumes the emergence of Cloud Brokers between customers and cloud providers. The brokers split user requests and ensure provisioning from multiple providers. An exact splitting algorithm is developed to efficiently split the cloud requests among the multiple cloud platforms with the aim of decreasing the cost for customers. This splitting is formulated as a Mixed Integer Program and this is combined with Open Flow and NOX technologies that achieve flow based inter-cloud networking. A new controller module is developed and integrated in NOX to configure the Open Flow switches for inter-cloud path establishments.

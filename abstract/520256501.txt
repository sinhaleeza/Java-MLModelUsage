As the rapid development of Internet of things, a large number of devices, instruments and sensors will connect and collaborate to achieve Smart Planet. One of the key challenges is to integrate devices into business process. SOA is an ideal infrastructure for business process management as applications are invoked using standard interfaces and protocols. It's convenient to use device-oriented web services (doWS) to encapsulate devices functions. A doWS may conflict with other doWS because devices can't be controlled by more than one client at the same time. This brings additional complexity to web service composition. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive device collaboration model to doWS choreography. This model includes device layer, doWS layer, compatible resource layer and process layer, where device layer represent devices, doWS layer encapsulates devices functions, compatible resource layer abstracts compatible device operations as resource and avoid of conflict, process layer describes the collaboration process. Analysis shows that, this model can integrate devices with Web Services, and can achieve the conflict detection of doWS. This model is effective in the Internet of things.

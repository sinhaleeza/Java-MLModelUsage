Web service composition is to integrate existing web services to provide a compound service which satisfies specified requirement. However, traditional web service compositions fail to provide different compound services under various scenarios. In this paper, we propose an approach to compose services with context. A context ontology is defined to describe the scenario for user. An abstract service description is defined to describe current three kinds of services including WSDL/Restful/Web API. The goal is to correlate context and service composition to improve the quality of the compound service from real services.

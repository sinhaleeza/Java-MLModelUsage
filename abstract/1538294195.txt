This paper presents a solution framework and implementation of a virus detection and vulnerability remediation (VDVR) system based on service- oriented architecture (SOA). VDVR system is an end to end, and Web based solution that searches/analyzes the output of a network detection system. VDVR system is also responsible for identifying affected machines, providing a workflow for managing the isolation of the machine from the network, remediating the infected machine, and reactivating the machine on the network.

In this demo, we present the current status of our visual scientific workflow management system called VIEW, highlighting the following two features: (i) the use of Semantic Web technology to represent, store, and query provenance metadata, leading to an interoperable and extensible provenance system, and (ii) the support of visualization of various provenance graphs and intermediate or final data products of a workflow run in the form of medical images or 3-D graphical models. VIEW seamlessly integrates the interoperability, extensibility, and reasoning advantages of Semantic Web technology, the querying and storage power of a RDBMS, and the appealing visual features of visualization techniques.

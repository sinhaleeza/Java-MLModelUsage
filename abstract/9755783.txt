To leverage the strengths of different distributed systems, a user may want to develop an application that spans multiple frameworks. Currently, in such cases a user needs to use a different code generator for each one of the distributed frameworks that the application incorporates. Learning the details of the interface specification and code generation tool for each one of these distributed frameworks is tedious and error-prone Instead, it is desirable to present the user with a flexible code generation framework that leverages the wide variety of available XML-based tools and is capable of generating code for all distributed systems. Our work involves the design and implementation of an XML schema based toolkit that can serve as the universal code generation toolkit for distributed frameworks.

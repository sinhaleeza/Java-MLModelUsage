Identity management is a key technology to enable federation of web services for authorized users. It mainly focuses on exchanging identity related information properly among web based systems. However, little attention has been given to multimedia services. We propose a design and architecture of a federating proxy that relays user's authentication and session related information to existing systems that employ different communication protocols. It provides a framework for bridging gap in the schema and syntax of the protocols while it reuses deployed infrastructure.

Traditional ways of collaboration among enterprises are no longer adequate and efficient due to increasingly short cycle times and constantly changing business circumstances. Companies compete as value chains using Business-to-Business (B2B) collaborations based on infocomm technologies, in particular the Internet. Most B2B collaborations are typically long term and static but are pushing towards short term and dynamic connectivity. This paper introduces a context-aware framework to support such short and dynamic B2B collaborations. In this framework, context information in terms of the user (company), temporal and location information is then used to match of suitable services to realize the business processes formed for B2B collaborations. An initial implementation of this approach is presented together with proposed improvements.

The papers in this special issue are designed to solicit innovative and promising methods and techniques related closely to cloud services in the era of Big Data. The concept of Cloud Service represents a prime facility and feature of services in a cloud computing environment that can be made available to users on demand. Due to the flexibility of cloud computing in scaling IT resources up and down, cloud services gradually become valuable to attract the gaze of researchers and engineers from both academia and industry when they are faced with dynamically changing business requirements. Different stakeholders, such as consumers, providers, and operators, are generating a vast amount of data on such services per minute on the Internet, which increasingly comes to show the “4V” characteristics of big data. Therefore, new methodologies and techniques are urgently required for designing, validating, developing, testing, and deploying cloud services on demand in this specific scenario based on big data, as well as for efficiently being adaptive to business dynamics and users’ explicit and implicit requirements.

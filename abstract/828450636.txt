Geospatial processing often involves complex and complicated geospatial data types. It is extremely inefficient if not infeasible to require scientist users maintain type compatibility of the ports of Web services that are connecting to each other. This study proposes to extend the type checking system of Kepler scientific workflow system to help scientist users composite geospatial Web services more effectively.

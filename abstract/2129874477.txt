In the literature, there exist several approaches for monitoring the execution of BPEL processes. They concentrate on different properties, adopt different languages, work at different levels of abstraction, and assume different perspectives. Even if the field is rather new, we do not think that this diversity is a limitation of current solutions; rather it is intrinsic in the problem itself. We claim that, instead of working on the definition of the ultimate approach for BPEL monitoring, we should push a cooperative approach based on the integration of different solutions.In this paper, we present a first step in this direction, and describe a monitoring framework which is obtained by integrating two well-known approaches, namely Dynamo and Astro. This integration, which happens both for the language used for expressing the properties to be monitored, and for the architecture of the monitoring framework, allows to combine the advantages of the two approaches and to obtain a general, comprehensive solutions for BPEL monitoring.

Software as a service is a well accepted software deployment and distribution model that has grown exponentially in the last few years. One of the biggest benefits of SaaS is the automated composition of different services in a composite system. It allows users to automatically find and bind these services (to maximize the productivity), meeting both functional and non-functional requirements. In this paper, we present a framework for modeling the dependency relationships among different Quality of Service parameters of the component services. Our proposed approach considers the different invocation patterns of component services, and presents a service composition framework to model the dependencies and uses the global QoS for service selection. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed technique on the WSDream-QoS Dataset [1] .

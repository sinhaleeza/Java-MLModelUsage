In this paper, we present the design and the architecture of the CloudDB AutoAdmin system which aims to fill the existing gaps between the provided cloud database services and the requirements of the consumer applications. In particular, it focuses on facilitating the job of the cloud database consumers in implementing database applications as distributed, scalable, and elastic services with a minimum effort on the side of the application developer and a limited footprint in the application code.

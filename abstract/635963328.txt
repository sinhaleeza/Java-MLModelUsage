The rapid development of mobile service ecosystem has made the APPs which access to the Internet an essential part of people's daily life. The APP is becoming increasingly large, and MicroService architecture has become the choice of many APP developers. However, the users' process of obtaining service is becoming tedious while using the APP that integrated various MicroServices, and there are no interactions among MicroServices. Users often install many APPs on their mobile devices. Facing some complex user requirements which go beyond the boundary of a single service, how to find the appropriate services and compose them becomes a critical issue. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a client-based MicroServices automatic collaboration(MSAC) framework. First, we build a fine-grained APP automatic collaboration meta-model, including a MicroService model and a collaboration model, to formally describe the issue of MSAC. Based on the meta-model, we develop a Micro Servitization tool to decompose the APP into client-based MicroServices that support the automatic collaboration and encapsulate them as normalized interfaces. We also develop an automatic collaboration engine to implement the automatic MicroService launching and the automatic injection of service parameters. Two real scenario cases demonstrate that our approach can efficiently simplify the user operations, reduce the network traffic and improve the user experience.

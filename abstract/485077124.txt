In multi-domain service-based systems, services from different domains are composed together to accomplish critical tasks. In these systems, data flow from one domain to another through the composed services. Thus, security and trustworthiness are the major concerns. Many access control models have been developed for service-based systems. Also, many data provenance schemes have been proposed in recent years to support data quality assessment and enhancement, data reproduction, etc. However, none of the existing mechanisms consider both access control and data provenance in an integrated model. In this paper, we propose an integrated role-based access control and data provenance model to secure the cross-domain interactions. We develop a role-based data provenance scheme which tracks the roles of originators/contributors of a data object and uses this information to help evaluate data trustworthiness. We also make use of the data provenance information and the derived data quality attributes to assist with cross domain access and information flow control. This integrated model mutually enhances data provenance and access control, providing better security and trustworthiness for many multi-domain service-based applications.

With the increment of grid computation, the data secure management and sharing has become more and more complex. NAS can reduce the cost of data management with its specification and scalability, it can accommodate to the requirement of distributed mass data storage management requirement for grid. This paper first presents a secure NAS framework on the grid and a secure storage model, and then analyses the secure policies and each module of framework, the performance analysis and future work are also given up at the last part.

Data management plays an important role in the fields of grid system. In conventional fields of software applications, like e-business applications, the single logical view of various types of distributed data resource and fine-grained access control are the most important requirements. The design and implementation of data management system which is responsible for meeting these requirements in the e-business application is proposed in this paper. The developed prototype of this data management system, as a very important component of the service-oriented manufacturing grid (MGrid) project, provides one single logical view to multiple heterogeneous storage resources so that these resources can be used in a uniform way by higher level applications. Also, fine-grained access control and the better reliability, manageability, location transparency, expandability and performance are also provided

Currently, business requirements for rapid operational efficiency, customer responsiveness as well as rapid adaptability are driving the need for ever increasing communication and integration capabilities of the software assets. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is generally acknowledged as being a potential solution to expose finely grained pieces of software components on a network that are reusable and composable. Provisioning of business services for different business purposes may require the rapid assembly of their core functionality with different infrastructure capabilities and policies in different contexts. In this paper, the authors propose a SOA based governance model that permits to handle non functional requirements in a dynamic way.

With increasing presence and adoption of Web services on the World Wide Web, Quality-of-Service (QoS) is becoming important for describing nonfunctional characteristics of Web services. In this paper, we present a collaborative filtering approach for predicting QoS values of Web services and making Web service recommendation by taking advantages of past usage experiences of service users. We first propose a user-collaborative mechanism for past Web service QoS information collection from different service users. Then, based on the collected QoS data, a collaborative filtering approach is designed to predict Web service QoS values. Finally, a prototype called WSRec is implemented by Java language and deployed to the Internet for conducting real-world experiments. To study the QoS value prediction accuracy of our approach, 1.5 millions Web service invocation results are collected from 150 service users in 24 countries on 100 real-world Web services in 22 countries. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves better prediction accuracy than other approaches. Our Web service QoS data set is publicly released for future research.

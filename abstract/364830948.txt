Users focus on their kernel business domain, and have no the ability to use directly the service flow and composite service components. Base on the Web application pattern, the consultation-model-based services application Model (CMSAM) is presented, and the business-model driven services flow framework is proposed in CMSAM. The CMSAM describes the different responsibility amongst the services requester, the consultation services provider, the domain services choreographer, the domain services provider, the content provider and content integrator. The CMSAM maps the service components onto the service executable environment through the business process model, the requirement model, the business process flow model, the abstract service flow model, the executable service flow model and the service instances. In the charging Algorithm, it is the objective function to minimize the service fee under the condition of searching successfully the suitable service for user's business function. At last, an implementation process of part modeling service is given in the product design and analysis domain for the CMSAM as an example.

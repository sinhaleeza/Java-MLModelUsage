With the advent of IoT (Internet of Things) age, considerable web services are emerging rapidly in service communities, which places a heavy burden on the target users' service selection decisions. In this situation, various techniques, e.g., collaborative filtering (i.e., CF) is introduced in service recommendation to alleviate the service selection burden. However, traditional CF-based service recommendation approaches often assume that the historical user-service quality data is centralized, while neglect the distributed recommendation situation. Generally, distributed service recommendation involves inevitable message communication among different parties and hence, brings challenging efficiency and privacy concerns. In view of this challenge, a novel privacy-preserving distributed service recommendation approach based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), i.e., DistSRLSH is put forward in this paper. Through LSH, DistSRLSH can achieve a good tradeoff among service recommendation accuracy, privacy-preservation and efficiency in distributed environment. Finally, through a set of experiments deployed on WS-DREAM dataset, we validate the feasibility of our proposal in handling distributed service recommendation problems.

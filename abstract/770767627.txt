This paper presents a Configurable Cloud Service Discovery and Selection System (C2SDS2) that aims to guide Cloud users in retrieving configurations of IaaS Cloud resources over the Internet. The C2SDS2 takes into account both user functional and non-functional requirements in the retrieval and selection process. In this work, configurable services are designed as directed Cloud extended feature graphs inspired by graph structures and feature models. The discovery-based matching is performed in two steps. In the first step, the structural matching is performed by adapting two heuristics: (1) Hungarian and (2) VG (Volgenant-Jonker) which is an improved Hungarian algorithm. In the second step, the QoS matching and ranking are achieved using three different methods of directed weighted graph matching namely the Eigen-decomposition, the Symmetric polynomial transform and the Linear programming methods. We show the efficiency and effectiveness of our system through an experimental study conducted on a configurable IaaS services collection. The experiment results show the performance and the efficiency of the algorithms combinations.

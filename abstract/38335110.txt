In this paper, we study legacy asset reuse for SOA design. Typically, the cost of reusing legacy assets is much lower than the cost of creating new services from scratch. As an extension of our SOA service modeling, we use top-down approaches to identify business services, and use asset modeling for legacy asset identification to find potential reusable assets for those services. Using service capacity analysis, we evaluate the maturity of a legacy asset for transformation to a service. Finally, we provide a model transformation to convert a service model with legacy assets into an SOA reference architecture model. Our effort integrates asset reuse as a part of the overall SOA design cycle and increases the possibility of asset reuse. To help architects use our method in engineering practice, we have implemented our method in the SOMA-ME tooling environment.

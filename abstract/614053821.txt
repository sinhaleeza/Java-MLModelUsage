This paper presents the applicability of service-oriented architecture to an e-engineering framework. The existing e-engineering framework models product development as engineering processes based on the collaboration of different experts who are participated in the development. And it aims to provide an integrated design environment to support integrating personnel, design activities and engineering resources during product development process. The applicability of the service-oriented architecture and web services technologies enable the framework to utilize and integrate effectively various engineering resources on the geographically distributed computing environments. And intelligent agent technologies support cooperation and coordination mechanisms for the engineering resources and services. In this paper we describe an implementation of the framework in detail and the application of it to the performance evaluation system for centrifugal pumps as a case study.

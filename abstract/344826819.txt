Maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) is important for self-healing web service-based distributed interactive applications. It requires the ability to deal with permanently changing constraints both at the communication and the execution levels. Preventing or repairing QoS degradation also requires the capacity of identifying its possible or actual sources and the capacity of reconfiguration decision and enforcement. Dealing with these issues is especially challenging for web services since the self-healing solution has to preserve the dynamic composition property and to be seamless for the service requesters, while being always usable under the different deployment constraints. In this paper, we present a self-healing middleware framework able to provide the self-healing properties for QoS management in web service-based distributed interactive applications. The framework implementation has been achieved in the context of the WS-DIAMOND project. It covers the whole cycle of adaptation management including monitoring and analysis of QoS values, and substitution-based reconfiguration.

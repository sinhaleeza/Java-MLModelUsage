As more web services are offered on the Web, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to manage and search for online content, using only flat keyword searching. Users often forget how they tagged their data but may remember generic information such as the location they were in when they took the picture. We describe a framework for personalized context-aware search of ontology-based tagged data. The tag ontology leverages additional information on data coming from a user and a resource, besides the tagged keyword, in order to augment search information. The framework uses general concepts taken from PeCMan, a personal content manager and GloServ, an ontology-based global service discovery system to implement the front-end and back-end of the overall system.

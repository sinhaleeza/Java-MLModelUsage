In this paper, we propose a methodology to drive innovation from isolated service islands into the global social service network to connect the islands. First, we propose Linked social service-specific principles based on Linked Data principles for publishing services on the open web as linked social services using our new service model, and then an approach is proposed to enable exploitation of a global social service network, providing Linked social service as a service.

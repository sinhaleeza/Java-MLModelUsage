This article proposes a new architectural principle for LISA (LInked Service Architecture) based on the Linked Data, ROA (Resource-Oriented Architecture), and meta-level service broker. LISA employs a two-layer architecture separating the concerns into meta-level of linking and base level of provisioning of services. A meta-level broker can dynamically coordinate services, and make the provisioning at the base level truly decentralized.

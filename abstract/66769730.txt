Trustworthiness has become a critical factor for users to choose the most suitable computing services for business or personal use. However, no standard exists for evaluation and comparison of service trustworthiness. So we try to propose a trustworthiness evaluation framework that can make standard or customized selection decisions based on common sense or user-defined specific trustworthiness criteria. This framework utilizes neural network and fuzzy logic to handle inaccuracy and subjectivity in trustworthiness evaluation. A feedback mechanism is also incorporated to make the entire framework be adaptive to users' preferences on different trust factors. A prototype is implemented to evaluate and compare different types of computing services. Experiments on today's popular email services and cloud-based online storage services prove the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed framework.

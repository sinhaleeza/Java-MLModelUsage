The Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL) is a specification developed by the W3C that can be viewed as a blueprint for the development of end-point services. Considering that it is the W3C candidate recommendation for web service choreography, it is worth providing a systematic approach for its modeling, analysis and verification. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto industry standard for modeling. Applying UML to model WS-CDL is obviously a promising solution to bring together academics and practitioners in through a unique standard language. This paper proposes to use different UML diagrams to model WS-CDL. Given the UML specification of WS-CDL, we then provide a systematic way of formally analyzing and verifying WS-CDL.

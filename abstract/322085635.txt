Web service composition is the process of integrating multiple independent Web Services into a coherent system that performs complex functions. This paper proposes an effective method for performing Web service composition and verification. We use Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to model Web services, composition patterns and users' requests. Based on the models, composition can be created by conducting TLA reasoning. The correctness of composition result can also be verified by checking whether the resulted TLA formula implements a user's request. A case study was conducted to illustrate the correctness of our approach.

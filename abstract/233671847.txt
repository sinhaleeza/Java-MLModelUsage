The properties of data and activities in business processes can be used to greatly facilitate several relevant tasks performed at design-and run-time, such as fragmentation, compliance checking, or top-down design. Business processes are often described using workflows, and we present an approach to mechanically infer business domain-specific attributes of workflow components, including data items, activities, and elements of sub-workflows, from known attributes of workflow inputs and the structure of the workflow by modeling these components as concepts and applying sharing analysis applied to a Horn clause representation of the workflow. The analysis is applicable to workflows featuring complex control and data dependencies, embedded control constructs, such as loops and branches, and embedded component services.

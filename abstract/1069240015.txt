We propose the Service Control Technology for the Web-telecom coordination service, and we show our proposal effectiveness. In the NGN (Next-Generation Network), many new applications are expected using open network interfaces. In particular, we study the SDP (Service Delivery Platform) for coordinating existing Internet services and telecom services. In this paper, we propose the Service control technology, which handles common process required in the telecom trigger Web-telecom coordination service. Our method achieves improvement in usability of telecom user, reliability of the coordination service, and processing performance. We implement our method two types (Proxy type, Callable type) and measured processing performance. In comparison to related technologies, we show our method effectiveness.

Web services technologies are emerging as a new approach for supporting e-science and e-engineering by providing access to heterogeneous computation resources and integration of distributed scientific applications. In this paper, we propose a Web portal architecture that enables end users to access the distributed application through the Web interface and to compose new tasks by integrating a set of high level Web services provided by portal developers. The portal design demonstrates that flexibility, reusability and interoperability can be provided for both end users and portal developers by using semantic Web services technologies.

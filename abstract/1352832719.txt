Rigorously trusted services depend on reliable evidences to describe and check service behaviors. In this paper, we propose the pi-SOA framework, which delivers mutually trusted services in a rigorous way. The framework allows clients to verify service behaviors remotely according to their trust policies and uniquely identify the verified service at all times during its executions. On the other hand, service providers in this framework can check that clients have agreed with the service behaviors before using the service.

Today, cloud computing applications are rapidly constructed by services belonging to different cloud providers and service owners. This work presents the inter-cloud elasticity framework, which focuses on cloud load balancing based on dynamic virtual machine reconfiguration when variations on load or on user requests volume are observed. We design a dynamic reconfiguration system, called inter-cloud load balancer (ICLB), that allows scaling up or down the virtual resources (thus providing automatized elasticity), by eliminating service downtimes and communication failures. It includes an inter-cloud load balancer for distributing incoming user HTTP traffic across multiple instances of inter-cloud applications and services and we perform dynamic reconfiguration of resources according to the real time requirements. The experimental analysis includes different topologies by showing how real-time traffic variation (using real world workloads) affects resource utilization and by achieving better resource usage in inter-cloud.

The shape of entities used in web services are mainly defined with the idea of a specific business case in mind. As soon as any third party uses these web services with another perception of the process, the shape of the entities may not be optimal any longer. Our paper proposes a solution that involves the service consumer party by letting the service consumer re-define the entities. Two architectural approaches are shown that provide an unobtrusive solution towards dynamic shaped web service entities. Furthermore we discuss the principles of declarative web services and the usage of context oriented programming for our concept of virtual endpoints.

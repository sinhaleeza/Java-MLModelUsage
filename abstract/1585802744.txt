As the amount of data generated by today's pervasive environments increases exponentially, there is a stronger need to decipher the important information that is hidden among it. By using complex event processing, we can obtain the information that really matters to our organization and use it to improve our processes. However, even when this information is retrieved, business processes remain static and cannot be changed dynamically to adapt to the actual scenario, diminishing the advantages that can be achieved. In this paper we present CEVICHE, a framework that combines the strengths of complex event processing and dynamic business process adaptation, which allows to respond to the needs of today's rapidly changing environments. We use a simple car rental scenario to show how CEVICHE could be used to maintain the quality of service of a business process by adapting it according to the situation.

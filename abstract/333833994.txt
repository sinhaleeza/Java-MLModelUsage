With REST becoming a popular paradigm for Web services, more and more use cases are applied to it, including some that require transactional guarantees. We propose a RESTful transaction model that satisfies both the constraints of transactions as well as those of the REST architectural style. We provide formal proof of consistency and recoverability in the proposed framework and show the robustness of its properties in the presence of concurrent transactions.

In recent years, the Web services composition has received much attention. By Web services composition, we mean taking advantage of currently existing Web services to provide a new service that does not exist on the repository. In this paper, we propose a new system called PSR for Web services composition search using a relational database. We also propose algorithms for pre-computing Web services composition using joins and indices. We demonstrated that our pre-computing Web services composition approach in RDBMS yields lower execution time and good scalability when handling a large number of Web services and user queries.

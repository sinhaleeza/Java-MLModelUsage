We propose a service-oriented approach to generate and manage mashups. The proposed approach is realized using the Mashup Services System (MSS), a novel platform to support users to create, use, and manage mashups with little or no programming effort. The proposed approach relieves users from programming-intensive, error-prone, and largely nonreusable output process for creating and maintaining mashups. We describe the overall design of MSS and discuss and evaluate its main enabling technologies.

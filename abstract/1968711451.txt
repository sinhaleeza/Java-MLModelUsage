Dependability is an important consideration during the design and development of IT systems and services. But in service computing systems, the traditional definition and evaluation methods from the systems' and components' point of view meet challenges. In this paper, we change the angle of view, and study the dependability and their attributes from the service-oriented perspective. A stochastic model using semi-Markov process is put forward, and the quantitative analysis of the dependability attributes is carried out. By extending and transforming this model, the mean time to dependability attributes failure is computed. Based on the analysis and calculations, some theorems are proposed and proved, to show the interrelationships and comparisons of the different dependability attributes.

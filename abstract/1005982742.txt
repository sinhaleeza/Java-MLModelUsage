Management architectures are well discussed in the literature, but their application in real life settings has not been as well covered. Automatic management of a system involves many more complexities than closing the control-loop by reacting to sensor data and executing corrective actions. In this paper, we discuss those complexities and propose solutions to those problems on top of Hasthi management framework, where Hasthi is a robust, scalable, and distributed management framework that enables users to manage a system by enforcing management logic authored by users themselves. Furthermore, we present in detail a real life case study, which uses Hasthi to manage a large, SOA based, e-science cyberinfrastructure.

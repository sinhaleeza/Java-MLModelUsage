With the development of web service applications, how to improve the efficiency of service discovery is an important research work in modern times. From the aspect of service function, this paper clusters web services to form service clusters based on service ontology which is generated by domain modeling. It can significantly reduce the overhead and enhance the service discovery efficiency. The corresponding service clustering algorithm and experiments are given to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

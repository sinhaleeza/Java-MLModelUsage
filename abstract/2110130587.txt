In this paper, we propose to use communities as a mean to organize Web services registries in a multi-registry environment. First, we propose a semantic model for Web services registry description (WSRD). A WSRD description depicts the functionalities offered by services advertised by a given registry. Thereafter, we propose an implicit approach for building communities based on the WSRD descriptions using a fuzzy clustering technique. Eventually, this clustering will be helpful for selecting an adequate registry for service requesters. Provided experiments in this paper show the feasibility of our approach.

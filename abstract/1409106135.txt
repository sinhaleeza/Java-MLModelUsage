This paper proposes a multi-request cooperative-integrating mechanism to optimize concurrent multi-applications in service-oriented wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, a sensor node is encapsulated as one or multiple WSN services, which can be categorized into service classes. A service network is constructed by considering the invocation relationship between service classes. Candidate service class chains are recommended. These service classes chains will be instantiated by available WSN services, which can be reduced to a multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization problem, where the spatial-and temporal-constraints, and energy efficiency of the network, are taken into consideration. This combinational optimization problem is solved by adopting heuristic algorithms. Experimental results show that this technique improves the shareability and energy efficiency for supporting concurrent applications.

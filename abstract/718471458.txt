Service retrieval holds a central role during the development of Web services and Service-Based Applications (SBAs). The higher the number of available services, the more complex it becomes to locate the service closer to the developer needs. The complexity increases further with the number of available service versions that could also be suitable for this purpose. Existing approaches on service retrieval use a similarity measure between service interfaces to identify potentially relevant services. In this work we focus on introducing information about the compatibility of services while calculating their similarity as the means for providing more suitable results. For this purpose we update and extend an existing Web services matchmaker called UDDI Registry by Example (URBE).

Service-oriented product lines provide a unified representation of variants of the possible applications of a specific domain. The configuration process is often completed by multi-stakeholders collaboratively. However, current configuration methods do not provide means to coordinate concurrent decision making. In this paper, we present a framework that describes the collaborative configuration process of Service-oriented Product lines based on fuzzy quality requirements. First, the configuration objective is obtained based on an improved fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making method. Then, the corresponding multi-objective evolutionary approaches are presented for product configuration and business process configuration that satisfy both functional and non-functional preferences and constraints, respectively.

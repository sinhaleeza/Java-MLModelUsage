Although EDI (electronic data interchange) have provided a useful method to the automated message interchanging between enterprises, this method costs a lot of money and resources, there is a new technology named ebXML (electronic business using eXtensible Markup Language) BPSS (business process specification schema) which provides a more easy way to integrate the whole business process. EbXML BPSS supports the specification of the set of elements required to configure a runtime system in order to execute a set of ebXML business transactions. EbXML BPSS describes which message should be interchanged and how to interchange, and provides a set of specification for the process automation. In this study, we propose a federated multi-agents system, which can implement the business process, and describe a detailed mechanism to apply the BPS to a prototype implementation.

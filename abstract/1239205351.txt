Managing a highly connected and heterogeneous computing environment requires the federation of various management systems (managers) across different platforms, technologies and systems. This research work is focusing on a generic manager-to-manager (M2M) interface, which enables a seamless cooperation between autonomous managers on the basis of Web services. Next to the standard Web services protocol stack, further emerging Web services specifications are reviewed in depth for the usability in this case study.

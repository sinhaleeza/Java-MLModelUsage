Data processing in environmental science is essential for doing science. The heterogeneity of data sources, data processing operations and infrastructures results in a lot of manual data and process integration work done by each scientist individually. This is very inefficient and time consuming. The aim is to provide a view based approach on accessing and processing data supporting a more generic infrastructure to integrate processing steps from different organizations, systems and libraries. We propose an approach modeled in Colored Place/Transition Nets which has been implemented in a Web Service infrastructure.

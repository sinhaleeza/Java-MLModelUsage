The grid information service (GIS), which is mainly used for resource discovery and monitoring, plays an important role in grid systems. Although many GIS systems have been proposed, e.g. MDS2, no appropriate solutions exist for the OGSA-based grid systems today. The architecture for OGSA-based GIS, i.e. FOSIS (forest structured information service), is proposed in this paper. FOSIS is featured by its forest structure, which is composed of multiple trees of GIS.

Data as a Service (DaaS) builds on service-oriented technologies to enable fast access to data resources on the Web. However, this paradigm raises several new privacy concerns that traditional privacy models do not handle. In addition, DaaS composition may reveal privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a formal privacy model in order to extend DaaS descriptions with privacy capabilities. The privacy model allows a service to define a privacy policy and a set of privacy requirements. We also propose a privacy-preserving DaaS composition approach allowing to verify the compatibility between privacy requirements and policies in DaaS composition. We propose a negotiation mechanism that makes it possible to dynamically reconcile the privacy capabilities of services when incompatibilities arise in a composition. We validate the applicability of our proposal through a prototype implementation and a set of experiments.

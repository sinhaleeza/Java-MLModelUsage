Increased trade and globalization has created an increasing need for the dynamic formulation and integration of cross-enterprise collaborative business processes (cBP's). However, current systems and methodologies, being static in nature, are unable to dynamically formulate cBP's based on business goals and selection criteria. Much of this stems from the current inability to bridge high level strategic business goals to low-level operational tasks, and the inability to dynamically decompose compound business process tasks into primitive operational tasks for direct Web service execution.In this paper, we demonstrate how the concepts from hierarchical task network (HTN) planning are feasible for dynamically creating cBP task sequences ideal for direct Web service execution. We also establish the rationale behind modeling business-to-business (B2B) collaboration tasks as hierarchical Web ontologies. To demonstrate the achievability of dynamic cBP formulation, we developed the genesis methodology, which consists of (1) business-OWL (BOWL) - a B2B hierarchical task Web ontology, and (2) the genesis algorithm - an extension of the hierarchical task network (HTN) planning algorithm to handle business criteria and control flows commonly found in business processes.

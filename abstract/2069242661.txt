Communications among Web services are asynchronous. Asynchronous models of service compositions face the problem that the performance of verification is bring down with states explosion. We describe an approach, which utilize the interaction-independence of component services in the composition and forms all component services into different groups. Preliminary experiment results show that the verification of service compositions upon these groups can decrease the size of exploration states and hence improve the performance.

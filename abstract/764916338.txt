Web services are software components that can be discovered and employed at runtime using the Internet. Conflicting requirements towards the nature of these services can be identified. From a business perspective, Web services promise to enable the formation of ad-hoc cooperations on a global scale. From a technical perspective, a high degree of standardization and rigorous specifications are required to enable the automated integration of Web services. A suitable technology for Web services has to mediate these needs for flexibility and stability. In this paper a new approach to the description of Web service semantics is introduced. It is a visual approach based on the use of software models and graph transformations and allows for the description of innovative services while providing a precise matching concept. An implementation using current standards and tools is available.

QoS-based service rating has made positive contributions to the area of service selection. Especially for Cloud service users, the right decision when choosing suitable Cloud services can help them improve user satisfaction and trading revenues. This work aims to address the issue of uncertainty in service requests, service descriptions, user and expert preferences, as well as evaluation criteria in a MCDM-based service selection procedure. A hybrid fuzzy framework for Cloud service selection is proposed, addressing the challenge using three approaches: a fuzzy-ontology-based approach for function matching and service filtering, a fuzzy AHP technique for informed criterion weighting, and, a fuzzy TOPSIS approach for service ranking.

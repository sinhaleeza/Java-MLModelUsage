This paper proposes an ontology-based framework and tool to guide the requirements engineering process in RAD projects for financial solution application development. The framework is aimed at empowering IT, business and solutions analysts with a knowledge repository that helps to address terminology gaps between different project stakeholders and quickly manage the requirements engineering process in response to rapidly changing business demands. We also illustrate how the framework and tool are being used to support RAD projects in the development of financial trading systems for a top 5 global investment bank. The framework and tool help to bridge the knowledge and communication gap alleviating the business-IT alignment problem in financial solution application development.

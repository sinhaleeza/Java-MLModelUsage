A configurable process model captures a family of similar processes. Such models can be configured to obtain a process variant according to specific requirements. With this aim, several approaches have been proposed for the configuration of process models. Nevertheless, an increasing attention is being paid to achieve this in a sound manner due to the complex inter-dependencies between the configuration decisions. In this work, we aim to guide the process analyst to easily configure process models while preserving soundness. To do so, we propose a formal approach for ensuring correctness of business process configurations while considering structural constraints they have to obey. Specifically, using the Event-B language, we formally define a configurable process model, its correctness-preserving conditions and its configuration constraints.

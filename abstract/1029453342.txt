This paper proposes WS-attestation, attestation architecture on Web services framework. We aim at providing software oriented, dynamic and fine-grained attestation mechanism that leverages TCG technologies to increase trust and confidence in integrity reporting. In addition, the architecture allows efficient binding of attestation with application context, privacy protection, as well as infrastructural support for attestation validation.

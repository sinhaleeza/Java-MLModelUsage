The notion of collaborative scientific workflow was coined to address the increasing need for collaborative data analytics using the scientific workflow technique. In such collaborative environments, adequate access control policies are necessary for controlling the sharing of workflows, data products, and provenance information among collaborating parties. Meanwhile, it is important to ensure that the evolution of workflow provenance access control policies meets certain qualities to guarantee the correctness and performance of the policy enforcement engine. To address this concern, this paper proposes a rolebased access control model for scientific workflow provenance. Three quality requirements are defined for scientific workflow provenance access control policies - consistency, completeness, and conciseness. A mapping mechanism from the specifications of workflows to their counterparts in the provenance is developed to preserve quality properties.

For protecting grid resources and grid applications, a behaviors-based trust model is introduced. The behaviors and trusts dynamically judge the secure levels of grid entities through the their history and actuality of behaviors. In this paper, the trust relationships among users, resources and applications are discussed, a new trust model based on behavior tracks is proposed by improving the components of reputation in traditional trust mode, and then an simple experimentation is given in our experimental grid using this model.

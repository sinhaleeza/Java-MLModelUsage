With the development of IoT and the linking of sensors to the cloud, the demand for event-driven service invocation continues to increase. Moreover, as sensors will be wrapped as Web services, sensor service composition is required in order to detect complex events cost effectively. As the observed environment targeted here changes continuously, iterated sensor service composition will be required to handle all situations. In this research, we first formalize sensor service composition as the constraint-based optimization problem (COP). Moreover, we introduce temporal constraints in the detection of the temporal relationships of complex events and thus realize enhanced sensor service composition.

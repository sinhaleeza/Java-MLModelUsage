Internet of Things (IoT) represents a cyber-physical world where physical things are interconnected on the Web. This paper presents an architecture designed for Energy-efficient Inter-organizational wireless sensor data collection Framework (EnIF). Environmental monitoring and urban sensing are two major application scenarios in IoT. Different from the traditional sensor environments, environmental sensing in IoT may require battery-powered nodes to perform the sensing tasks. Such a requirement raises a critical challenge to ensure that sensor data gathering can be collected in a timely and energy-efficient manner. Although numerous energy-efficient approaches for IoT scenarios have been proposed, previous works assumed the entire network was managed by a single organization in which the network establishment and communication have been pre-configured. This assumption is inconsistent with the fact that IoT is established in a federated network with heterogeneous devices controlled by different organizations. The aim of the framework is to enable a dynamic inter-organizational collaborative topology towards saving energy from data transmissions using a service-oriented architecture.

Scientific workflow has recently become an enabling technology to automate and speed up the scientific discovery process. Although several scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs) have been developed, a formal scientific workflow composition model in which workflow constructs are fully compositional one with another is still missing. In this paper, we propose a dataflow-based scientific workflow composition framework consisting of (1) a dataflow-based scientific workflow model that separates the declaration of the workflow interface from the definition of its functional body; (2) a set of workflow constructs, including Map, Reduce, Tree, Loop, Conditional, and Curry, which are fully compositional one with another; (3) a dataflow-based exception handling approach to support hierarchical exception propagation and user-defined exception handling. Our workflow composition framework is unique in that workflows are the only operands for composition; in this way, our approach elegantly solves the two-world problem in existing composition frameworks, in which composition needs to deal with both the world of tasks and the world of workflows. The proposed framework is implemented and several case studies are conducted to validate our techniques.

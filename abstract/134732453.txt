To respond quickly to the market, the organization must be able to create, manage and optimize dynamic business process. Building up dynamic process using multi predefined process units can lead to higher efficiency in fulfilling complex business goals. Among all valuable information business process, current business process management systems only reuse the workflow model, which is of a relatively lower level, and cannot fully support process unit composition. This paper suggests that business process should be regarded as a kind of knowledge, and reuse of this knowledge should cover a much wider range. A business knowledge reuse framework is discussed. We define process component as a unit for process knowledge management and reuse. The ontology of process component is expatriated in detail. Process component model is a key factor in realizing process knowledge reuse and organizational learning.

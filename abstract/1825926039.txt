A fault situation occurs to a service needs to be well analyzed and handled in order to ensure the reliability of composite service. The analysis can be driven by understanding the impact caused by the faulty service on the other services as well as the entire composition. Existing works have given less attention to this issue, in particular, the temporal impact situation caused by the fault. Thus, we propose an approach to analyzing the temporal impact and generating the impact region. The region can be utilized by the handling mechanism to prioritize the services to be repaired. The approach begins by estimating the updated temporal behavior of the composite service after the fault situation occurs, followed by identifying the potential candidates of the impact region. The concept of temporal negative impact is introduced to support the identification activity. Intuitively, the approach can assist in reducing the number of service changes in handling the fault situation.

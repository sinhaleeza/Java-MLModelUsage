Service composition is complex. It has to reach a set of pre-defined non-functional qualities, like security for instance, which requires the production of complicated code.This code, often distributed between client and server sides, is highly error-prone and difficult to maintain. In this paper, we present a generative environment for the orchestration of abstract services and the separate specification of non-functional properties. This environment has been built within the European SODA project and validated on several industrial use cases. In this paper, we focus on an alarm management scenario with stringent security requirements.

How to deploy more services while keeping the Quality of Services is one of the key challenges faced by the resource management of cloud platforms, especially for PaaS. Existing approaches focus mainly on cloud platforms which mainly host small number of applications, and consider few features of different applications. In this paper, we present SORM, a Service-Oriented Resource Management mechanism on cloud platforms. The core of SORM is a service feature model which involves resource consumption and request variance of services. For each server, SORM deploys service instances with complementary resource consumption, so as to improve resource utilization. SORM also divides servers into three pools and deploys service instances onto different pools, mainly based on their request variance features, so as to reduce computational over-head of resource management and keep cloud platforms stable. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SORM by simulation experiments and find that: compared with one exiting approach. SORM can deploy 3.6 times more services with nearly 74.1% time cost.

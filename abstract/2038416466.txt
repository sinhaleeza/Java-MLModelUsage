Traditional web services transaction processing mechanism handle exception by forward recovery and backward recovery. These compensation mechanisms often lead to waste of resources and time. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting outcomes of service executions as part of service compositions which allows to choose service instances that are likely to lead to a successful result in the first instance and thus reduces the need for invoking costly recovery mechanisms. The framework makes use of watchdogs to maintain an awareness of service availability and a pre-coordinator which has oversight of the whole composite Web service and acts as a control center. An analysis of a scenario shows that we cannot only provide users with a more satisfactory result, but also can reduce the overhead costs of resources and waste.

Scientific workflows have been widely used by scientists to accelerate research experiments and achieve scientific discoveries. Due to the nature of science, scientific workflows often involve complex workflow design and distributed computation resources, so abnormal events are likely to happen and interrupt the normal execution of workflows. Restarting workflows is often too expensive and painful to do, especially for those long-running workflows. Thus, exception handling plays a significant role in the context of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on exception handling in the VIEW scientific workflow management system.

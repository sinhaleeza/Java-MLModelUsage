Social media have been used in the detection and management of natural hazards such as earthquakes. However, disasters often lead to other kinds of disasters, forming multi-hazards. Landslide is an illustrative example of a multi-hazard, which may be caused by earthquakes, rainfalls, water erosion, among other reasons. Detecting such multi-hazards is a significant challenge, since physical sensors designed for specific disasters are insufficient for multi-hazards. We describe LITMUS -- a landslide detection service based on a multi-service composition approach that combines data from both physical and social information services by filtering and then joining the information flow from those services based on their spatiotemporal features. Our results show that with such approach LITMUS detects 25 out of 27 landslides reported by USGS in December and 40 more landslides unreported by USGS. Also, LITMUS provides a live demonstration that displays results on a web map.

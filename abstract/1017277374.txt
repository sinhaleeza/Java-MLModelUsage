There is a need for the creation of virtual organizations where services offered by one organization should become accessible to other organizations. The proposed model virtual service-oriented architecture, makes the information discovery process across organizations more flexible and efficient by introducing a cache registry. A Web services architecture is realized using the Websphere message broker and WAS servers. The proposed approach is compared with extended services oriented architecture. Results show that caching significantly improves the response time.

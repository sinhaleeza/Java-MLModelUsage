With the increased use of small screen devices in today's society, there is an increasing need to access useful information through these devices. Despite the popularity of smartphones, most websites are designed for a desktop computer monitor. Current approaches to make these websites small screen friendly, result in website images being handled in a naive fashion. For example, images are simply resized or removed with no regards to their content or purpose. This paper proposes a middleware service, involving both image analysis and image classification techniques, to determine the purpose of these images within a website. This knowledge can then be used to relocate, resample, resize and/or remove these images accordingly.

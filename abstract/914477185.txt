Nowadays, service oriented architecture (SOA) has become one mainstream paradigm for developing distributed applications. As the basic unit in SOA, web services can be composed to construct complex applications. The quality of web services and their compositions is critical to the success of SOA applications. Testing, as a major quality assurance technique, is confronted with new challenges in the context of service compositions. In this paper, we propose a scenario-oriented testing approach that can automatically generate test cases for service compositions. Our approach is particularly focused on the service compositions specified by Business Process Execution Language for web services (WS-BPEL), a widely recognized executable service composition language. In the approach, a WS-BPEL service composition is first abstracted into a graph model; test scenarios are then derived from the model; finally, test cases are generated according to different scenarios. We also developed a prototype tool implementing the proposed approach, and an empirical study was conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that the automatic scenario-oriented testing approach is effective in detecting many types of faults seeded in the service compositions.

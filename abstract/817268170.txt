It is considered that Web services have had a tremendous impact on the web as a potential silver bullet for supporting a distributed service-based economy on a global scale. However, despite the outstanding progress, their uptake on a web scale has been significantly less than initially anticipated. Isolated service islands without links to related services have hampered service discovery and composition. In this paper, we propose a methodology to drive innovation from isolated service islands into the global social service network to connect the service islands. First, we propose Linked social service-specific principles based on Linked Data principles for publishing services on the open web as linked social services, and suggest a new platform for constructing a global social service network. Then, an approach is proposed to enable exploitation of a global social service network, providing workflow as a service. Finally, experimental results show that Linked social service can solve the service composition problem by enabling providing workflow as a service based on the global social service network, and has the potential to be the next wave of services.

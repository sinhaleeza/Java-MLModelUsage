This paper proposes a multiagent based distributed control system for an intelligent robot that is an integration of many functional modules. According to the whole requirements of the system, many agents and a distributed blackboard system are designed so that the system realizes a very flexible robot control from the low level such as servo control to the high level control such as motion planning. It especially analyzes functions of agents and presents results of preliminary experiments with real robot system.

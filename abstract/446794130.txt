Since current heterogeneous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have not been designed to work in a cooperative manner, sharing security information among them poses a serious challenge especially in large-scale High Speed Networks (HSN) environment. The integration become more difficult when we should reduce computing and memory costs incurred by the high speed IDSs communication. Fortunately Web Services technology represents a good choice for IDSs integration thanks to its characteristics such as platform transparency and loose coupling. In this context, this paper presents a lightweight RESTful Communication model for coordinating different high speed distributed IDSs. Experimental results show an important gain in terms of data exchanged size and transmission time.

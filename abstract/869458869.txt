In workflow systems or other applications, users need more semantic information. Ontologies and semantic Web are important technologies for managing semantic information. Our work is focused on semantic spatial information in distributed workflow. The spatial relations was described by Description Logic, the ontologies was then constructed using the RDF Schemas and OWL Capabilities. These theories and methods are enclosed in a middleware, and the middleware was embedded in workflow system of the government in Jilin Province.

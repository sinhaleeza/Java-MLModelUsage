I am very happy to report that TSC has gained an Impact Factor (IF) of 3.520 and the 5-year IF of 4.245, both of which represent significant increases from the previous years. This further speaks to the global reputation of the journal and the amazing work done by the past EICs, all the current and past EB members, and reviewers - all of whom have volunteered their precious time despite their very busy schedule to support and contribute to the growth of this journal. I hope to count on your continued engagement for the future growth of this journal. Over this past year, several esteemed EB members have completed their terms of service to TSC after serving for several years. On behalf of the Services Computing community and the TSC EAB, I would like to thank the following Associate Editors who retired from TSC EB in 2017 for their invaluable service and contributions to the journal. Overall, I am very proud of the success that TSC has achieved in 2017. This would not have been possible without the continued support of the authors, readers, reviewers, TSC EAB, TSC EB, and the staff of IEEE and IEEE Computer Society. I look forward to exploring ways to further enhance the reputation and impact of our journal. I would love to hear your suggestions and comments, and I hope to have your continued support.

We present a technique called Dynamic Distributed Service Coordination Protocol (DDSCP) that enables dynamic and distributed coordination for composed services and applications in telecommunication networks. Individual service components are modeled as Web services and DDSCP facilitates coordination among these components by dispatching executable processes to the service components that specify different steps that the service component must follow in response to (receipt of) specific messages and events. The collective and concurrent execution of these processes at different service components achieves overall goals of the service. The planning and creation of these processes is not our focus in this paper. We describe the structure and processing of different messages DDSCP, and describe how this protocol can work. Our model has several advantages over the existing service platforms for 3rd Generation Mobile Networks, such as Parlay/OSA, and the Web-service composition models. These advantages include introduction of flexibility among network components at finest level, ease of creation of highly customized services, easy integration with foreign components, reduced application complexity, increased reuse of application components, and possibility of increased user participation in managing her services, and thus reducing load on the network.

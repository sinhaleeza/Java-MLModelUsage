The selection of Web services is typically based on both functional and nonfunctional attributes of the service, such as the quality of service (QoS) levels. Reputation, a widely acknowledged nonfunctional QoS attribute is currently expressed as the average of user ratings given to the service. However, this expression confines reputation to the subjective perception of the end user and is limited by the lack of an objective representation of performance history. In this paper, we address the need for a reputation mechanism that couples the subjective perception of the end user with the objective view of performance history. To represent performance history, we propose a novel QoS metric termed verity. Verity measures the degree of consistency exhibited by the service provider in delivering the quality levels laid out in the service contract, over a range of previous transactions. We express reputation as a composition of user rating, the compliance levels exhibited by the provider and the verity value. We contend that this reputation expression is a more viable attribute of quality than user rating alone.

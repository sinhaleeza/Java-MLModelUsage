Efficient query processing over a large amount of business process models is important for managing the business process model repository. The structural similarity between two process models is considered as the main measurement for ranking the process models for a given search model. Current business process query methods are inefficient since too many expensive computations of the graph edit distance are involved for constructing the elements mapping as well as deriving the structural similarity. To address this, using Petri-net as the modelling method, this paper presents the Hungarian algorithm based query method, where we firstly define the context similarity for a pair of place nodes that are from different process models by taking into account both the common paths and common transitions, then transform the elements (e.g., The transitions and the places) mapping to classical assignment problem that can be solved by Hungarian algorithm efficiently. In this way, we can save a lot of time for searching the best combination of elements mapping. Finally, we use the common method of the graph edit distance to measure the structural similarity based on the found best combination of elements mapping.

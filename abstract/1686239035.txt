Component Business Modeling (CBM) designs a framework for defining non-overlapping, independent, reusable, cost-effective business components or service centers that provide business services. CBM is gaining broad acceptance in today's marketplace. On the other hand, compliance with industry standards is becoming an imperative in today's enterprises. We propose a bottom-up method for deriving business components from industry standards, based on the artifact-centric approach. In a climate of constant and unpredictable change, alignment between service centers and industry standards becomes essential to the success of enterprises.

Current Web users usually have their own files, work documents, communications and personal contacts distributed in the storage systems of many widely-used Internet services(e.g. Google Docs, Gmail, Facebook, Zoho). Therefore, they face the challenge of being not able to have an integrated view for their related data objects (e.g. mails, pics, docs, contacts). Recently, most of the major Internet services provide standard APIs that allow developing software applications that can read and write data from their underlying data store after providing the credential access information of registered accounts. The MyDeepWeb system is designed to let the Web users interact with their Internet services normally while, behind the scene, the information of their objects will be extracted, consolidated, linked and then populated into a single private cloud-based data store where the user can have integrated access to their data objects from anywhere through multiple devices.

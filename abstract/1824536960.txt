Nowadays, application needs loose-coupling approach allowing asynchronous evolution. Service-oriented computing is a paradigm that utilizes services as fundamental elements for application design, and fulfills loose-coupling requirement. However, services themselves are typically only used to abstract remote functionality; the service-oriented approach proffered by web services does not promote an implementation model managing service dynamism. This paper proposes iPOJO, a service-oriented component to implement services. However, this component model does not only manage dynamic service interactions; it also provides an extensibility mechanism. IPOJO Components can manage other non-functional properties as persistency, security, autonomic management, eventing... To illustrate the approach, the paper presents a usage of iPOJO on a residential gateway.

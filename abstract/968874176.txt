This tutorial will take the audience through an "aggregated" SOA engagement and discuss key processes, activities, and deliverables through the entire life cycle, especially in service modeling, realization, integration through an enterprise service bus and governance. Best practices and some anti-patterns will also be presented and discussed. It is mostly based on some of the speakers' pioneering project practices and lessons learned since SOA and Web service's inception.

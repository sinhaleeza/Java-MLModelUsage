This paper proposes a novel trust evaluation method for service choreography. Compared with current work towards this problem, it considers not only the trust for individual partner services and the explicit trust relation among partner services that have logical dependencies for each other, but also the implicit trust relation implied in data-dependencies among services. A serial of experiments, using the simulation tool Net Logo, are carried out to compare the evaluation results between the proposed method and the method without data-dependency consideration. The result shows that taking consideration of the data-dependency trust improves the accuracy of trust evaluation to a great extent.

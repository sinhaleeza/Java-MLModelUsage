In this paper, we propose a formal framework for checking the consistency of security policies of services using Answer Set Programming (ASP). We illustrate that the formalisation of security policies of the service providers and the service consumers in ASP is an effective way for reasoning about the compatibility of policies to enable the dynamic discovery and invocation of services.

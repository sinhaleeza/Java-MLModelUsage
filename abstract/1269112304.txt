This paper describes the methodology and practices in applying cloud in China top banks' next generation banking system. The core banking system will help China top banks from world largest retail banks into integrated financial services providers. The services-oriented new system will require reliable, flexible and manageable infrastructure frameworks. The existing data centers do not meet the criteria. This paper describes a new approach for mapping application patterns onto private cloud based technology services. The application patterns will be mapped into deployment patterns, which will help data centers to provide orchestration just-in-time. Meanwhile, Key Performance Indicators are identified for manage the non-functional requirements of application components. The frameworks, together with key algorithms are described in the paper. The paper comes from real design projects in China top banks, which have over 4 thousand million accounts. This is the first time to use private cloud in such a large enterprise core business.

The development of the Internet and Web 2.0 eased communication among people and triggered the flourish of Web based communities. Among them, there are blog, social networks, music networks, and recommendation network, etc. There are also communities of massively multiplayer online games. In particular, 3D based virtual worlds, like Second Life, are highly welcomed by people. Users contribute to these communities while at the same time obtain value from the communities instead of passive browsing. The relationships among the community members and community services could be represented by different types of networks. The topology of networks influence the way how people interact and information spread within the community. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to facilitate the communities to grow into scale-free networks. Scale-free communities have good properties that could potentially speed up its accumulation of value for both the members and the community itself. We extend WSDL into scale-free Web services using Web services resource framework.

Several approaches to web service selection and recommendation via collaborative filtering have been studied, but seldom have these studies considered the difference between web service recommendation and product recommendation used in e-commerce sites. In this paper, we present RegionKNN, a novel hybrid collaborative filtering algorithm that is designed for large scale web service recommendation. Different from other approaches, this method employs the characteristics of QoS by building an efficient region model. Based on this model, web service recommendations will be generated quickly by using modified memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that apart from being highly scalable, RegionKNN provides considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy by comparing with other well-known collaborative filtering algorithms.

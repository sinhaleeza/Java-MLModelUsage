In service-based systems, service evolution might raise critical communication issues since the client cannot be aware of the changes that have occurred on the black-box services side. In this paper, we propose an automated process to adapt the client to the changes that have occurred. Our approach relies on a compatibility measuring method, and changes the client interface to ensure the system compatibility. This solution is fully automated inside a prototype tool we have implemented.

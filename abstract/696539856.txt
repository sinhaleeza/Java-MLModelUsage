Service oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style to reuse and integrate subsystems in existing systems for designing new applications. Each application is designed in an implementation independent manner using abstract concepts: network services and connections between network services. In SOA, the non-functional aspects of services and connections should be described separately from their functional aspects because different applications use services and connections in different non-functional contexts. This paper proposes a UML profile to graphically design the non-functional aspects in SOA and maintain them in an implementation independent manner. This paper presents the design of the proposed UML profile and describes how it is used in service-oriented application development

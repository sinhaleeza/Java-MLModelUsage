In a distributed Web service integration environment, the selection of Web services should be based on their reputation and quality-of-service (QoS). Various trust models for web services have been proposed to evaluate the reputation of Web services/service providers. Current mechanisms are based on tracing the feedbacks to the past behaviors of Web services. However, very few of them consider the robustness and attack-resiliency of the trust models. In this paper, we present an attack resilient distributed trust management system in a Web service management environment. The proposed attack resilient trust model uses two vectors to capture the behavior and the trustworthiness of a Web service/service provider based on our analysis on the possible attacks against the trust models. We also present a set of experiments that show the effectiveness of our trust model in detecting malicious behavior of service providers.

The implementation of business processes with services allows applying the design principle of separation of concerns by defining, on the one hand, the specification of the business process in a model, and on the other hand, software services to support specific automated parts of the model. Both technologies and platforms for services implementation and execution have evolved considerably over the years, but is not the same for services design. The Service Oriented Architecture Modeling Language (SoaML)is a standard that allows the specification of most service concepts -by extending UML elements-and code generation from these elements. In this paper we present an approach for generating service models in SoaML and the code to support the execution of specific parts of BPMN 2.0 business processes. We extended previous work by means of adding new mappings regarding Service tasks and basic workflow patterns in orchestrations for internal use of services.

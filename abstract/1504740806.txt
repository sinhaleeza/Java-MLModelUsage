Service oriented architecture is widely adopted, accepted and appreciated for both horizontal and vertical integration of enterprise applications. The success is hugely aided by web service composition, which is a temporal collaboration of independent and loosely-coupled web services to execute a business process at runtime. In the Future Internet, the present practice of composition, the most popular variant of which is service orchestration, is expected to face a lot of problems due to its inherent centralized orientation. As a result, service choreography is widely viewed as an ideal replacement candidate. However, achieving a decentralized collaboration of autonomous, 'non-aligned' and loosely-coupled web services is a challenge. To systematically enact a web service choreography, the present infrastructure has to address several complications. In this paper, we present several atypical issues faced by service choreography and the technological advancements required for its enactment. Based on the proposed solution, we develop a prototype with 'stateless' RESTful web services. The entire prototype is deployed in-house (within the Institute) on a virtualized platform.

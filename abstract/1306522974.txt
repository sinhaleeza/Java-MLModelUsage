In e-service environment, enterprises need to collaborate to achieve a common business goal in loose-coupling manner. Therefore, it is of great necessity to develop a service interoperation technique that is capable of handling the collaboration among distributed business processes. The Web services architecture defines separate specifications for the choreography and orchestration of Web services. This paper proposes a service choreography solution for business collaboration across organizations boundaries while preserving the local autonomy of their own business processes. A centralized service choreography process is built for specification of the global business process, and then it is transformed to decentralized choreography processes amongst the participants for peer-to-peer interaction. For each participant, a data dependency based process mediation model is developed to facilitate the adaptation between the local pre-established business process and its corresponding decentralized choreography process. This mediation means can ensure the privacy and autonomy of local business process and the adaptability of choreography process. A system architecture is implemented to support our solution in ONCE PI project

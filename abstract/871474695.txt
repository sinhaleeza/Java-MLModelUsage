When two Web services work together, they exchange messages in a predefined interface process. Two interface processes should be compatible when they can work properly. Our idea to fix incompatibility problem in service processes is to change an incompatible process so that the new process can simulate a compatible process. We consider not only the control flow but also the data flow in modeling the processes into FSMs. We present a technique that not only detects the incompatibility, but also provides resolution strategies to generate the new process.

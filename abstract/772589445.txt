Topological dynamics of mobile peer-to-peer are exacerbated by the changes of mobile user's location and interest. We observe that the velocity representation of mobile nodes provides a characterization of the mobility groups. We attempt to predict the future availability of wireless links based on group mobility model. Intuitively, mobile peers within the same group tend to have a high probability of keeping stable interconnection topology. We use the velocity-group model, which helps us predict the future availability of wireless links and leads to fast amplifying the system's total streaming capacity using its self-growing. The extensive simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed model in mobile peer-to-peer media streaming system.

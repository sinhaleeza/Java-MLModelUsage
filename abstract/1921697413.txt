Organizations sharing common goals are required to integrate their software systems in order set up collaborative business processes (BPs). An integration platform with a Business Process Management System (BPMS) can offer the needed technological support to realize these processes. Also, including widely used social platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) provides support for realizing human tasks within the BPMS. In this paper, we propose a process-aware inter-organizational service integration platform to allow the interaction between collaborating organizations. The platform extends a defined integration platform by adding support for the execution of collaborative BPs and can be used within different domains.

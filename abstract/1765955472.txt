Today, Web services are pervasive and omnipresent in the Internet and within enterprises. Even though there are massive Web services specifications development underway, early adoption by developers and tool vendors is becoming a need. The potential growth of this technology is highly predictable because of its universal acceptance and use among the developer community. This industry may expect to grow enormously based on the support from various communities that benefit from this technology. Researches are carried out in various standards bodies on various aspects of Web services such as definition, architecture, security, discovery, interoperability, etc. As we are committed to the success of this technology, we need to research on service oriented containers that makes Web services potential more constructive. This paper proposes a container for Web services which can manage and monitor the state and behavior of Web services, which may address the quality of service (QoS) factor for Web services.

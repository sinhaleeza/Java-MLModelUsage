The paradigm of the cloud computing model brings the expectations of the services consumed from the cloud to be always on and available for global consumption around the clock. Hence, the challenge for the service providers becomes to accommodate the planned maintenance windows to keep them to a minimum duration in order to reduce the impact on the consumers of their services. In this paper, we assess the continuous delivery methodology called Blue/Green deployment which targets to enable service updates with zero maintenance windows, and thus with no disruption to the end users. To overcome current issues we proposed an optimized Blue/Green technique based on automated service discovery, dynamic routing and automated application deployment. Our experiments indicate that the service discovery based Blue/Green deployment has a better performance for service continuous delivery compared to the available technologies.

In recent years, a number of scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs) have been developed to help domain scientists synergistically integrate distributed computations, datasets, and analysis tools to enable and accelerate scientific discoveries. As more scientific research projects become collaborative in nature, there is a compelling need of dedicated services to support collaborative scientific workflows on the Internet. This paper reviews the state of the art of the field of scientific workflows towards the support of collaborative scientific workflows, identifies critical research challenges, and presents our ongoing research work aiming to study how to create services supporting collaborative scientific workflows.

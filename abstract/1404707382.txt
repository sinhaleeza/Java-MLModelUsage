This paper presents a middleware that supports reliable Web services built on active replication. The middleware is responsible for maintaining the consistency of the replicas' states. A Java package for handling the interactions with the middleware and the failures of the Web services is provided for programmers to use when writing client applications. The package reduces the complexity in developing client applications.

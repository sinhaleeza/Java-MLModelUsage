What Is Innovation? It’s not always about inventing something entirely new. Innovation occurs at the intersection of invention and insight. It’s about the application of invention - the fusion of new developments and new approaches to solve problems. (Sam Palmisano, Delivered at the Council on Competitiveness Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C., October 30, 2003). In the 21st Century, we are approaching fundamental limits of technology that will drive new paradigms for software and systems. Software complexity is driving a rethinking of software development. There are external forces including government and societal, that are significantly influencing the technology agenda. In addition, the changing business environment demands new approaches to use of IT - transformation must be fueled by innovation. Can we manage innovation? Can we create a culture of innovation? Can we work with customers and partners to drive innovation? Various innovation approaches are being deployed to enhance IBM’s innovation ecosystem. Lessons learned and future innovation drivers will be presented.

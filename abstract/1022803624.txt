With the rapid development of location-based services in mobile Internet, spatial keyword queries have been widely employed in various real-life applications in recent years. To realize the great flexibility and cost savings, more and more data owners are motivated to outsource their spatio-textual data services to the cloud. However, directly outsourcing such services to the untrusted cloud may arise serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we study the privacy-preserving top-
$k$ 
 spatial keyword query problem in untrusted cloud environments. Existing studies primarily focus on the design of privacy-preserving schemes for either spatial or keyword queries, and they cannot be applied to solve the privacy-preserving spatial keyword query problem. To address this problem, we present a novel privacy-preserving top-
$k$ 
 spatial keyword query scheme. In particular, we build an encrypted tree index to facilitate privacy-preserving top- 
$k$ 
 spatial keyword queries, where spatial and textual data are encrypted in a unified way. To search with the encrypted tree index, we propose two effective techniques for the similarity computations between queries and tree nodes under encryption. To improve query performance on large-scale spatio-textual data, we further propose a keyword-based secure pruning method. Thorough analysis shows the validity and security of our scheme. Extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate our scheme achieves high efficiency and good scalability.

With the emergence of Business Process Outsourcing and Cloud Computing, enterprises are looking for available business processes outside of their organizations to quickly adopt to new business requirements and also reduce process development and maintenance costs. The process execution needs to be governed as policy enforcement might differ between different clients. Since a process is deployed outside of the organizations and serves multiple process clients, distribution and multi-tenancy have become two requirements for runtime governance of service processes. We address this problem by introducing a policy-oriented aspectual business process framework. The runtime governance from process clients are integrated as aspects through dynamic weaving into process execution.

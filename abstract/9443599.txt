Today, the proliferation of mobile devices coupled with the widespread availability of the Internet is opening up new service opportunities in numerous areas. However, developing mobile applications turns out to be very challenging. Two major plagues are heterogeneity and the need for dynamic adaptation happening at runtime. Dealing with these aspects leads to several problems and impasses. In this paper, we present a service-oriented component model for the development of hybrid mobile applications. This model allows developers to produce mobile applications more rapidly and reduces maintenance costs. An in-depth evaluation on several industrial applications of this model is also presented showing its benefits.

In Web service composition, the benefit conflicts between the user and the service provider ask the so-called both win to be supported. To address this concern, a novel QoS-guaranteed service composition approach based on a win-win strategy is proposed in this paper. First, a QoS model based on the probability interval is built to adapt to the dynamic nature of the Internet, and a corresponding user satisfaction evaluation method is designed. Next, a mathematical model of service composition based on game theory is proposed. Finally, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search an appropriate composite service with the Pareto optimum under the Nash equilibrium on both the user utility and the service provider utility achieved or approached. Simulation results have shown that the proposed approach is feasible and effective.

Business transaction recovery is the fundamental approach of handling exceptions during execution as well as ensuring transaction features. In this paper context is applied to recovery of the web service business transaction and exceptions are classified into four categories: network exception, physical exception, service exception and user exception. Based on the classifications we define different start points of recovery process to simplify the recovery process of business transaction. Also evaluations on contexts of exceptions are performed to extract the feasible instances of compensation paths and the sensibility weights of path costs are utilized to select the optimal compensation instance. An illustration to recovery scenarios for travel agent is presented to verify our approach and algorithms.

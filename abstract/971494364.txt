This paper provides a generalized approach for building a QoS based registry for service oriented architecture. This framework enhances the current universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI) standard in order to achieve better search efficiency and improved quality of search based on user specified QoS parameters. The proposed model does not require any changes or modification to the current UDDI standard but provides a middleware repository that is used to store a valid subset of the UDDI data with QoS specifications. The proposed framework is expandable to include additional quality of service parameters depending on the application. The implementation of this framework illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed QoS based registry.

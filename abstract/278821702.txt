Today, the techniques for realizing service compositions (e.g. WS-BPEL) have become mature. Nevertheless, when it comes to execution faults within service compositions, many problems are still unsolved. Especially the propagation and global handling of errors in service compositions yet remains an open issue. In this paper, we describe some preliminary results of our ongoing work in the field of fault propagation and exception handling in service compositions. We provide some service classification criteria and show how they relate to service composition fault handling. Further, we present a fault propagation approach for service compositions.

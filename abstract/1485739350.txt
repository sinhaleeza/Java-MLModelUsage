This paper sets out key issues of exception handling that relate to identifying, analyzing and dealing with an exception in service-oriented systems. Then required concepts, basic structures and algorithms for the Ml-Eh are discussed. The new concepts include the super-space of exception definitions, the meta-definition mode, and components in an exception message. The main characteristics of the Ml-Eh are a uniform definition mode, dynamical extensibility, and abilities of configurable analyses and encapsulations, and a message-level combination. Finally, implementation and evaluation of the mechanism is given

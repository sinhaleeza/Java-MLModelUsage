This paper presents an extension to OWL-Q, a prominent semantic quality-based service description language, called Q-SLA, enabling to specify SLAs. This extension advances the state-of-the-art by covering all possible information aspects needed to enable proper and automatic support to all service management activities. A particular use-case is also provided highlighting Q-SLA's main benefits.

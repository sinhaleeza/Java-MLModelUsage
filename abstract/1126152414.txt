This paper presents a distributed service management infrastructure called BISE. One distinguishing feature of BISE is its adoption of the peer-to-peer (P2P) model in support of realtime service managements. BISE offers significant advantages over existing systems in scalability, resilience, and manageability. Current P2P algorithms are mainly developed for the file-sharing applications running on desktops, which have characteristics dramatically different from enterprise data centers. This difference led us to design our own P2P algorithms specifically optimized for enterprise environments. Based on these algorithms, we implemented a P2P substrate called BiseWeaver (25,000 lines of Java code) as the core of BISE. Our evaluation on a set of distributed machines shows that BiseWeaver is efficient and robust, and provides timely monitoring data in support of proactive SLA management

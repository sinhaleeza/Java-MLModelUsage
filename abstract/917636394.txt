This paper focuses on clustering alerts around common root causes at the lower levels of the event management chain. The aim is to enable root-cause identification from a mixed event stream and to offer aggregated information for holistic problem solving. This end-to-end investigation spans feature selection and similarity assessment, clustering on heterogeneous feature maps, and evaluation of results. We compare feature values based on network information, user-defined similarity matrices, and textual analysis, and capture aspects of feature correlation in the event similarity function. Spectral clustering partitions the stream and serves to learn a more general similarity metric from a reference partitioning. Finally, we introduce two novel result visualization techniques and make a case study on one identified root-cause for which this framework outperforms both a time-pressured human operator and baseline clustering algorithms.

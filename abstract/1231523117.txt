Service compositions are established to implement complex functionality based on elementary services in different application areas. The execution time of a service composition is crucial in many application domains. A service composition is said to be time-critical when its execution time is restricted. Because of uncertain response times, the execution time restriction of a time-critical service composition can be violated. Several reconfiguration approaches dealing with service failures and deviating QoS values were recently proposed, but because of their general purpose, they do not consider specific characteristics that occur in the presence of uncertain response times. In this paper, a time-sensitive reconfiguration is proposed that takes into account the uncertainty of response times and the temporal conditions found at execution time of a time-critical service composition. It is shown that a reliable execution of time-critical service compositions is achieved with only slightly increased cost.

The number of Web services has substantially increased in response to the needs of business activities. Moreover, toolsets and APIs ensuring the easy development and deployment of these services have emerged. As a result, the number of registries holding the great deal of Web services has also increased. Therefore, binding these services, whenever the user needs to reuse them, is time and effort consuming. To cope with this problem and in response to the limits of current approaches, we propose a local repository-based approach to optimize the binding of the frequently used Web services. Furthermore, an experimental study is presented to situate the proposed approach to other ones dealing with the binding feature of Web services.

The introduction of mobile clients and context-aware behaviors into Web Service compositions may generate faults and inconsistencies. We introduce an extension of a composition model where context-awareness is made explicit and a number of correctness properties are verifiable. In particular, our extended model enables the verification of properties commonly used to validate context dependent applications. We also propose a set of algorithms to verify these properties efficiently.

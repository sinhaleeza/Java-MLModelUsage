We present a formal method to derive a set of web services from a given choreography, in such a way that the system consisting of these services necessarily conforms to the choreography. A formal model to represent orchestrations and choreographies is given, and we define several conformance semantic relations allowing to detect whether a set of orchestration models, representing some web services, leads to the overall communications described by a choreography.

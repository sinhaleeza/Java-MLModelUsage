The rapid advance of technologies like Web services enables solutions to exploit more and more of the potential of the Web in many ways, recently especially in the field of federating distributed systems within or between businesses. To sustain maintainability and cope with the evolving application life cycles, a global uniform view on all involved sub systems and underlying infrastructure is required. This can be provided by a model that serves as a map for the landscape of the overall system to act as a guide to evolution. In this paper, we introduce the i2Map as an approach to these modeling demands focused on federable Web-service-based applications.

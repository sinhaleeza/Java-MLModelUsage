Previews of web links are typically generated based on the metadata captured from the URL content. Sometimes, the preview sentences are extracted by means of content summarization. Such web link previews can be seen in different apps like the web browser, chat app, messaging or email apps etc. These previews are static in nature and do not change with respect to changing context. Therefore, they may not be particularly relevant to the receiver of the link. In this paper, we present a web service for generating intelligent previews in a chat application, which captures the local intent of the user from the chat content and uses it to display only relevant content extracted from the previewed URL. Since the user intent can change dynamically, our system generated previews are also dynamic, which change on the fly if it detects a change of topic being discussed in the current chat. We describe details of a prototype web service implementation, with three methods for preview generation based on TF-IDF and Word2Vec word embedding. We also present results of an evaluation using shared URLs from a private real-world chat group as well as a sample chat app with a few users to determine the accuracy of the preview generation system.

With the increasing popularity of using Web services, Quality of Service (QoS) is becoming a significant concern for both service consumers and providers. Several models for considering functional and non-functional QoS requirements for the purpose of Web service discovery and selection have been proposed. We present in this paper a new Web services selection model based on fuzzy logic. In this model, the non-functional QoS requirements are taken into account for the appropriate selection of required services. Our model can handle consumers' imprecise preferences with fuzzy sets. Moreover, a new fuzzy ranking algorithm that is based on the dependencies between quality attributes is proposed. The experimental results obtained from real world Web service domains revealed better performance of our algorithm compared to Entropy-based ranking algorithms.

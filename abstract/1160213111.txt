We define a service delivery system as a set of interacting entities that are involved in the delivery of one or more business services. A service operating system manages the processes and resources within a service delivery system. This paper presents our on-going work on developing a formal model for these concepts, with the goal of clearly and precisely describing the delivery behavior of service systems. The model lays the groundwork for reasoning about the scenarios that occur in service delivery.

The DynaSOAr framework presents a wholly service-oriented approach to grid and Internet-based computing that makes a clear and explicit separation of concerns between service-provision and resource-provision for each service invocation. The separation allows the dynamic deployment of code at runtime, in the form of a service implementation, between a service provider and an explicit resource provider. This paper presents work in progress towards an integrated tripartite security model and framework that enables the security constraints of each engaging party to be expressed, propagated, unified and enforced as part of a DynaSOAr service invocation.

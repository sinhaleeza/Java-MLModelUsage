We present our work on implementing elemental services for carrying out design optimisation on the grid. The service-oriented approach makes it possible to harness the best available technologies that may often be incompatible due to heterogeneous software environments. It also facilitates the creation of an integrated problem solving environment (PSE) for design optimisation. We explain in detail how state-of-the-art Web services technologies are exploited to build these facilities, yield the desired quality of service, and demonstrate how service based design optimisation workflows constructed using script languages can be used to solve design optimisation problems from different paradigms.

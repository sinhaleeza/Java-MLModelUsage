This paper addresses automatic service composition (ASC) as a means to create new value-added services dynamically and automatically from existing services in service-oriented architecture and cloud computing environments. Manually composing services for relatively static applications has been successful, but automatically composing services requires advances in the semantics of processes and an architectural framework that can capture all stages of an application's lifecycle. A framework for ASC involves four stages: planning an execution workflow, discovering services from a registry, selecting the best candidate services, and executing the selected services. This four-stage architecture is the most widely used to describe ASC, but it is still abstract and incomplete in terms of scalable goal composition, property transformation for seamless automatic composition, and integration architecture. We present a workflow orchestration to enable nested multilevel composition for achieving scalability. We add to the four-stage composition framework a transformation method for abstract composition properties. A general model for the composition architecture is described herein and a complete and detailed composition framework is introduced using our model. Our ASC architecture achieves improved seamlessness and scalability in the integrated framework. The ASC architecture is analyzed and evaluated to show its efficacy.

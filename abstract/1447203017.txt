Currently Web services composition problems are addressed using AI planning techniques. The team-based approach, with emphases on the sharing of mental models and proactive collaboration, provides an alternative to current static approaches to Web service composition. The approach provides clear advantages for proactive handling of failures that may be encountered during execution of a complex Web service. The paper proposes a generic framework for dynamic Web-service composition, and extends the CAST architecture to realize the framework.

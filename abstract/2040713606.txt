In this paper we describe a platform that supports context aware runtime service discovery. The platform supports service discovery based on structural and behavioural service models as well as complex context related service discovery conditions which are specified in a newly introduced query language. During discovery, context information is obtained through a uniform scheme of calling "context operations" and is subsequently used in the evaluation of service discovery queries.

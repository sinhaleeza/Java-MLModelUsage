Software-as-a-service emerges as a new delivery model for the software development and applications. In multi-tenancy applications, tenants can customize and adjust the corresponding services shared by tenants based on their business requirements with strong elasticity and expansibility. As services do not exist independently, the resolving of service dependencies in practical multi-tenancy applications is of great importance. In this paper, we propose an Extended Dependency-aware Hierarchical Service Model (EDHSM) to visually describe hierarchical services and service dependencies. We employ a directed hypergraph to represent the model and resolve service dependencies. Moreover, we apply the service dependencies resolving to dynamic service deployment in optimal placement of tenants and online service migration based on load monitoring for multi-tenancy applications. So application systems can be built quickly and operated stably at a low maintaining cost.

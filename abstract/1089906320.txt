As Web services become more prevalent, the need to ensure their quality increases. This paper explores the criteria of reliability of Web services-oriented systems, and discusses how to design and generate test cases to conduct tests over Web services. A prototype system is constructed to test the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms. The preliminary results show that our approach facilitates the testing of services-oriented systems.

While the usage of web services has increased explosively in recent years, very few studies examined the characteristics of web services using large-scale real data for a long period of time. In this paper, we present one such a large scale longitudinal analysis of publicly available web services of SOAP-based and RESTful types. For the period of roughly one year and from five different world-wide locations, we closely monitor the ups and downs of various basic properties of web services and their QoS values using a total of 825,132 real web services.

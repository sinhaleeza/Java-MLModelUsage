A fundamental issue of human-centered coordinating services in ubiquitous computing is concerned with dynamic service coordination according to users' intentions. How can we coordinate the services to assist the user in receiving a coordinated service to maximize the user's satisfaction in an environment? In order to solve this issue, we have been developing a sort of agent-based coordination framework, called "location-mediated agent coordination," that orchestrates Web services embedded in the real world and Web services on the Internet. In this paper, we show a prototype application of the framework, context-aware information assist services in a museum.

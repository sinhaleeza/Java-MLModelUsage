Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a widely used similarity search technique for many web services, such as content-based retrieval services for images and videos. Due to its popularity, much research effort has been devoted to improving the search quality, and the indexing and query performance of LSH. However, most existing variants of LSH can only run on single node, which limits their applicability to large-scale data. In this paper, we present a Shuffle-Efficient Similarity Search scheme based on LSH, which can be efficiently executed in distributed environments, to serve a massive amount of data. In SES-LSH, a shuffle efficient indexing scheme is proposed to reduce the data shuffle when constructing hash tables, and a location-aware querying scheme is proposed to improve the query performance. We have implemented a prototype of SES-LSH based on Spark, and several optimizations have been utilized to improve the fine-grained hash table operations of distributed LSH. Extensive experiments using large-scale real-world datasets show that SES-LSH is remarkably more efficient than existing methods.

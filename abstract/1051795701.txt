We introduce a logic model to formally specify the semantics of workflows and their composite tasks described as BPEL4WS abstract processes. Based on the model, we present a set of inference rules to deduce the strongest postcondition and weakest precondition of a workflow and demonstrate that automatic workflow verification is possible due to the restrictions on data manipulation in an abstract process. We then sketch an algorithm that automatically synthesizes a workflow given its specification and a task library.

Most of the current semantic representation methods for service capabilities are usually based on top-down methodology. We aim to develop services characterization methods with statistical study on existing Web services and to improve services capability representation with bottom-up software services comprehension. Two services characterization methods are proposed in our work: quantitative statistical study which used for probing the distribution of main objects in Web services and relational statistical study which used for clustering actions or contents and measuring the similarity of Web services. A statistical relational model is proposed for mining and recognizing the patterns of services.

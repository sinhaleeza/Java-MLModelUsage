To automate the analysis of service descriptions, [?] proposed a simple and expressive business protocol model (the specification of possible message exchange sequences) based on state machines, supporting rich timing constraints. Furthermore, developers of client applications need to be aware not only of functional aspects but also of non-functional aspects including privacy. In fact, the major concerns of a client are the disclosure of its personnel data conveyed during the message exchange. The aim of the paper is to study the ability of business protocol to handle the privacy and its time-related properties.

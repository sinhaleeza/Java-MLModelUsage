As Web services are widely adopted, the nonfunctional requirements (i.e. QoS constraints) have become a significant factor in implementing trustworthy and predictable service applications. In this paper, we analyze the QoS publishing necessity, and categorize QoS parameters to refine their characteristics. Then we propose a conceptual publishing model, which is adaptive for the distributed and decentralized service-oriented computing environment. We further introduce the perception service quality measurement models, and extend P-E model for web services. The extended model takes both dynamic QoS parameters and customer expectations into consideration. A compensation mechanism is also incorporated into the model for trade-off when nonfunctional requirements cannot be fully satisfied.

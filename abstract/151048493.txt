We propose a framework for intelligent document routing that extends XML technologies and enables realtime update of business routing logic. A novel feature of our system is the ability to semi-automate the process of creating and updating the routing rules. This is achieved by a closed loop system that performs clustering and inductive rule learning of document features. This framework was tested and deployed in a large real-world enterprise environment resulting in reduced development costs and simplified administration. The user interacts with the system using an application to graphically create, edit and publish the business processes

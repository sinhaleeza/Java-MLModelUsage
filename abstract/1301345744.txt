New value-added services, generated by business process systems that composes services to fulfill user requirements, provide more powerful and flexible features. In most traditional process-centric business process design methods, developing work is largely devoted to data operating in back end business logic and front UI, while control flow design gives less information than implementing a complete business process that may require a much greater level of detail. It's a big challenge to automate these code generations in business process system development. This paper proposes an automatic code generation approach for web based business process software systems based on artifact-oriented business process application development, which can generate front UI and back end business logic code. The approach is applied to developing a practical heating repair business process software system, and the experimental data verify the advantages the proposed approach brought to us in generating code effectively, saving labor force and avoiding coding mistakes.

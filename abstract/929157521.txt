First, if IVF is a caller to other eBay internal Web Services for Cross Border Trade business, what can we do to keep IVF machines healthy and fully functional in the instance other Web Services take more than three seconds to return the response? Second, as a Web Services provider to serve item visibility information to other applications, how can IVF return response of hundred items to clients in milliseconds? Both questions are discussed in this paper. Solution and results are presented with conclusion.

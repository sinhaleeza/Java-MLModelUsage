This paper describes a model for capturing service designs and the design of service product lines. The model promotes reuse of service artifacts, enables a balanced view of the service from different stakeholder viewpoints, and provides a foundation for design for service quality. The model leverages a phased approach to design, engineering and management of services. The model has applicability throughout the service lifecycle and provides a standardized vocabulary and structure for designing and maintaining generic services, irrespective of the domain of application.

Large-scale graphs processing, which draws attentions of researchers, applies in a large range of domains. However, large-scale graphs processing on traditional platforms suffers from difficulties including computation and memory inefficiency. To enhance the computation-efficiency and energy-efficiency, in this paper, we exploit graph processing services on the energy-efficient hardware accelerator, called Domino. Domino adopts the asynchronous model to process graphs, which is efficient for many graph algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and Single Source Shortest Path. Domino also proposes a specific data structure based on row vectors to present graphs, named Batch Row Vector. Besides, our work employs naive update mechanism and bisect update mechanism to perform the asynchronous control. Ultimately, we implement Domino on an advanced Xilinx Virtex-7 board, and experimental results demonstrated that Domino has a significant performance and energy improvement. Case studies in Domino achieve 1.47x-7.84x and 0.47x-2.52x average speedup for small-diameter graphs(e.g., com-youtube, WikiTalk, and soc-LiveJournal), over GraphChi on the Intel Core2 and Core i7 processors, respectively. Besides, compared to Intel Core i7 processors, Domino also performs a significant energy-efficiency that is 2.03x-10.08x for three small-diameter graphs and 27.98x-134.50x for roadNet-CA which is a graph with relatively large diameter.

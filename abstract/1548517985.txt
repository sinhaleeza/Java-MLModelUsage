In the mobile Internet, users mostly work with handheld devices with limited computing power and small screens. Their access conditions also change more frequently. In this paper, we present a novel service supporting intelligent content adaptation to better suit handheld devices. The underlying technique is a unit of information (UOI)-based content adaptation method, which automatically detects semantic relationships among comprising components in Web contents, and then reorganizes page layout to fit handheld devices based on identified Ious. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables more exquisite content adaptation.

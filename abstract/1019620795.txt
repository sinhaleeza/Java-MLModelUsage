Resources are the basis of a grid, and their description is important for a grid user to discover and access resources. Grid resource describing is divided into two parts: resource description and resource specification. In this paper, an XML-based Grid Resource Specification Language is defined. A grid resource registry meta-service is then designed based on GRSL. A resource registry meta-service is implemented and tested. The test and tryout indicate that GRSL results in a powerful extensible framework for grid resource specification and discovery.

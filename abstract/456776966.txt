In order for e-government to be successful there is a strong requirement for approaches that are based on widely accepted technical standards and formal design methods. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the eMayor platform, a Web services based platform that is built as a holistic service framework for the deployment and delivery of e-government enterprise services for European municipalities. The design of the platform is based on the ISO/RM-ODP standard. The goal of the paper is to present both a general architectural overview of the platform and its services, along with the engineering and technology aspects of the architecture as instances of the engineering and technology viewpoints of the RM-ODP standard.

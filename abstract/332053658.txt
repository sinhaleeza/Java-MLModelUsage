Component business modeling (CBM) serves as a powerful analytical framework for reasoning about the business as a set of business components that collaborate through the provision and consumption of business services. This paper proposes and illustrates a method to calculate the relative importance of the entities that make up a componentized enterprise architecture. The proposed method includes a formal definition of the importance of each entity in the business architecture calculated from the high level business values.

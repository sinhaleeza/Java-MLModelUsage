Innovation in services has become a topic of interest to researchers due to the worldwide shift to "services" economics. This comes from the growth of services economies and the shift to services businesses by manufacturing industries, including IT-related industries. This growth of services encourages us to study basic business system changes from product-based to service economies and to define the fundamental challenges to accelerate service innovations. These interdisciplinary activities are called services sciences, management, and engineering (SSME), which includes computer science, operations research, industrial engineering, business strategy, management sciences, social and cognitive sciences, legal sciences, and innovation management. Innovations, in particular, service innovations are difficult to articulate their structures and mechanisms, due to intangibility coming from services characteristics, and a lack of languages to describe them. In this paper, we investigate 1. How can we capture the characteristics of innovations as patterns? 2. What are the categories of patterns for innovations? We introduce innovation pattern categories and patterns from enterprise viewpoints, and apply them to innovation cases. We identify future study areas, such as innovation ecosystem modeling, and innovation lifecycle studies using innovation patterns.

The Participatory Design Studio (PDS) provides users across multiple sites the ability to effectively participate in a common design session. Users are provided a variety of shared resources, including the underlying high-speed network, cameras, displays, sound equipment, large data files, and software applications for communicating and for visualizing the artifact being designed. This paper explores the design and implementation of PDS, and describes how it leverages the benefits of a service-oriented architecture (SoA) to provide a highly adaptable, modular, and loosely coupled solution. PDS integrates systems that are hosted on a wide variety of platforms with different management and network domains. This integration goes beyond piping application data from one system to another. Web services provide a cost-effective solution for integrating these systems into a comprehensive SoA

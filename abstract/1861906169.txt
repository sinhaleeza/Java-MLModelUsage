We propose a new framework for social-sensor cloud services selection based on spatio-textual correlation between user's query and service. The proposed research defines a formal social-sensor cloud service model that abstracts the functional and non-functional aspects of social-sensor data on the cloud in terms of spatio-temporal, textual and quality of service parameters. Proposed framework is a 4-stage filtering algorithm, to select social-sensor cloud services based on user query and quality of service demands. 4-stage filtering is based on spatial correlation, textual correlation, visual features and quality of service parameters. Analytical results are presented to show the performance of the proposed approach.

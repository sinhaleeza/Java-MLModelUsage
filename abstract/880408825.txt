Web service registries play an important role in service oriented applications. They constitute the market where service consumers and providers go to search and advertise Web services. With the proliferation of Web service registries, finding an adequate registry has become a complex task for a service requester. In this paper we propose a semantic model for Web services registry description (WSRD). WSRD descriptions depict the functionalities offered by services advertised by a given registry since they rely on these descriptions. We also propose a functionality-driven clustering approach for distributed Web service registries. This approach is based on a fuzzy clustering technique and allows structuring distributed registries based on their WSRD descriptions without any additional data. This clustering will be helpful for selecting an adequate registry for service requesters.

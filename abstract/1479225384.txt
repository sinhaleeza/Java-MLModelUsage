This paper analyses the well known web services representations based on web services descriptions and more generally on the content of WSDL files to evaluate their interest for discovery, clustering and recommendation tasks.Unfortunately, this analysis shows that these representations are very basic and do not lead to good results. Therefore,we introduce a new representation called symbolic reputation which is computed from relationships between web services.Different implementation issues are discussed and the results considering real world web services are analysed to determine the usefulness of the introduced representations for web services discovery, clustering and recommendation.

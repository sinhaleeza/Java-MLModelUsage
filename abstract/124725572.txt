A location-aware news feed (LANF) system generates news feeds for a mobile user based on her spatial preference (i.e., her current location and future locations) and non-spatial preference (i.e., her interest). Existing LANF systems simply send the most relevant geo-tagged messages to their users. Unfortunately, the major limitation of such an existing approach is that, a news feed may contain messages related to the same location (i.e., point-of-interest) or the same category of locations (e.g., food, entertainment or sport). We argue that diversity is a very important feature for location-aware news feeds because it helps users discover new places and activities. In this paper, we propose D-MobiFeed; a new LANF system enables a user to specify the minimum number of message categories (h) for the messages in a news feed. In D-MobiFeed, our objective is to efficiently schedule news feeds for a mobile user at her current and predicted locations, such that (i) each news feed contains messages belonging to at least h different categories, and (ii) their total relevance to the user is maximized. To achieve this objective, we formulate the problem into two parts, namely, a decision problem and an optimization problem. For the decision problem, we provide an exact solution by modeling it as a maximum flow problem and proving its correctness. The optimization problem is solved by our proposed three-stage heuristic algorithm. We conduct a user study and experiments to evaluate the performance of D-MobiFeed using a real data set crawled from Foursquare. Experimental results show that our proposed three-stage heuristic scheduling algorithm outperforms the brute-force optimal algorithm by at least an order of magnitude in terms of running time and the relative error incurred by the heuristic algorithm is below 1 percent. D-MobiFeed with the location prediction method effectively improves the relevance, diversity, and efficiency of news feeds.

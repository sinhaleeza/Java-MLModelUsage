Web portals are a means for presentation level integration of enterprise applications and services. We describe an approach for enhancing presentation level integration in Web portals by supporting communication between presentation level components. The approach is based on established standards in this area and allows the exchange of structured XML-data between local and remote applications and services. Since the approach is mostly declarative, it can also be used for improving integration of already existing presentation components.

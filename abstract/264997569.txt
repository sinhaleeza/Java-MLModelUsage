Attempting to reduce the complexity of applying constraints to service deployment and guarantee its correctness, we propose a declarative constraint solution which includes three distinctive components: constraint pattern definition component, pattern-based constraint description component, and pattern-based violation analysis component. Correspondingly, a supporting tool for this solution is implemented and integrated with the deployment topology plan tool.

Classroom scheduling problem has long been proven to be a NP-Complete problem. This paper presents a novel services-oriented scheduling approach. Regarding each type of resource as a service, Smart Class originally introduces SOA into this problem to efficiently facilitate educational programmers with the design space exploration (DSE) and greedy algorithms based approach. Furthermore, the Smart Class architecture can be dynamically coupled to different algorithms to fit in any specific demands. Typical case studies demonstrate that Smart Class provides a new efficient research paradigm to the traditional problem of class scheduling, providing high flexibility and scalability.

The Web services stack of standards is designed to support the reuse and the interoperation of software components on the Web. A critical step in the process of developing applications based on the service oriented architecture is the service discovery. This paper shows how service composition can be used as a technique to support service discovery. The paper discusses the current state of research in this area and introduces a semantic matching algorithm that exploits the possibility to compose multiple services in order to satisfy a service request.

Accurate capacity measurement of Internet services is critical to ensure high-performing production computing environments. In this work, we present our solution of performing accurate capacity measurement. Referred to as "Redliner", it uses live traffic in production environments to drive the measurement, hence avoiding many pitfalls that prevent capacity measurement from obtaining accurate values in synthetic lab environment. Redliner works by intelligently redirecting a portion of production traffic to the SUT (Service Under Test) and realtime analyzing the performance. It has been adopted by hundreds of services inside LinkedIn and is executed for various types of capacity analysis on a daily basis.

Service network analysis is an essential aspect of web service discovery, search, mining and recommendation. Many popular web service networks are content-rich in terms of heterogeneous types of entities, attributes and links. A main challenge for ranking services is how to incorporate multiple complex and heterogeneous factors, such as service attributes, relationships between services, relationships between services and service providers or service consumers, into the design of service ranking functions. In this paper, we model services, attributes, and the associated entities, such as providers, consumers, by a heterogeneous service network. We propose a unified neighborhood random walk distance measure, which integrates various types of links and vertex attributes by a local optimal weight assignment. Based on this unified distance measure, a reinforcement algorithm, ServiceRank, is provided to tightly integrate ranking and clustering by mutually and simultaneously enhancing each other such that the performance of both can be improved. An additional clustering matching strategy is proposed to efficiently align clusters from different types of objects. Our extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real service networks demonstrates the effectiveness of ServiceRank in terms of the quality of both clustering and ranking among multiple types of entity, link and attribute similarities in a service network.

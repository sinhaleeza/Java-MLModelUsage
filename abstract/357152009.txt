Context-awareness (CA) has been applied in different domains, particularly in ubiquitous computing, to provide better value-added services. CA has also been used, albeit sporadically, in business related applications. This paper discusses an on-going research effort in enhancing Business-to-Business (B2B) collaborations through context awareness, specifically to support the formation of short and dynamic connectivity between partners collaborating in a supply chain. Through an understanding of context awareness and how companies evaluate and select prospective suppliers, a B2B Context Model is proposed to discover and match suitable partners. The prospective partners are represented as services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm.

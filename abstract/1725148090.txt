The web service computing paradigm has introduced great benefits to the growth of e-markets, both under the customer to business and the business to business models. The value capabilities allowed by the conception of web services, such as interoperability, efficiency, just-in-time integration, etc., have made them the most common way of doing business online. With the maturation of the web services underlying functional properties and facilitating standards, and with the proliferation of the amounts of data they use and they generate, researchers and practitioners have been dedicating considerable efforts to the related emerging privacy concerns. The literature contains number of research works on these privacy concerns, each addressing them from a different focal point. We have explored the available literature on web services privacy during transactions, to present, in this paper, a thorough survey of the most relevant published proposals. We identified 20 works that address privacy related problems in web services consumption. We categorize them based on the approach they take and we compare them based on a proposed evaluation framework, derived from the adopted techniques and addressed requirements.

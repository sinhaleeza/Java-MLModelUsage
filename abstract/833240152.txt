This paper investigates the problem of reputation management in composite services. Our focus is on developing a method of distribution of reputation received by a composite service to its component services. The proposed method enables the composite service to provide a fair distribution of reputation values so that a component service is neither penalized nor awarded for the bad and good performances respectively, of other component services. Experiment results show that the proposed technique propagates the "fair share" of reputation from the composite service to its component services.

Integrating heterogeneous scientific dataset and high performance computing resources, and thus providing integrated Web services is an important goal for informazation project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Cloud computing delivers computing and storage capacity as a transparent service to different communities of inter-disciplinary scientists, which inspires us to develop a SaaS (Software as a Service) cloud for collaborative virtual laboratory named VLAB-C. VLAB-C provides three key features including the ability of high performance on large scale of data processing and large amount of communities' collaboration, elastic computing for collaborative services, and extensible open framework for customized Web service integration through developing the components such as the micro-kernel container, the cloud infrastructure, and the open service. We gave several experiments on VLAB-C of its performance, which showed our system achieves considerable efficiency with cloud computing.

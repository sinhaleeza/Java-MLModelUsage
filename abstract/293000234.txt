We propose architectural properties required for supporting automatic service composition. After defining composable service architecture, we proceed to examine the role of trust and reputation systems in such environment. Based on the proposed infrastructure we give several options for achieving automatic service composition, under the assumption that previously defined requirements are architecturally supported. Finally, we discuss the impact and outlook for automatic composition.

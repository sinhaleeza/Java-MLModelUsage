This paper proposes Event-driven SOA as an extension of SOA for business process collaboration in Internet of Things (IoT). Compared with traditional SOA based service collaboration method, this approach will facilitate real-time event processing as well as decentralized and autonomous service coordination. We illustrate the collaboration process under the proposed architecture by applying it to a smart surgical management scenario.

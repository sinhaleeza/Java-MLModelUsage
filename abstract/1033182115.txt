This paper describes the realization of Tele-portal, an agent-based Web services platform. Tele-portal utilizes two important concepts in the field of distributed computing: the concept of services and agent. We present the whole architecture of the Tele-portal system. The main contribution of this work is that it provides a methodology and prototype implementation of a service-oriented electronic commerce environment. We suggest that this approach has the flexibility necessary to provide agent-oriented designs for open and complex application, and has value for future maintenance and extension of these systems.

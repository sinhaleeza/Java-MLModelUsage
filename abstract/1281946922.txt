Hadoop, the open-source implementation of MapReduce, has been widely used in different projects. However, when users want to use this parallel computing framework, they have to spend time on the Hadoop cluster configuration, learning the programming API, and the MapReduce job operations. This paper proposes the Parallel Computing Framework as a Cloud Service (PCFCS) to provide the users parallel computing cluster, and simplify the configuration, programming, uploading, and operating procedures. Especially, PCFCS defines a set of annotations, with which users can quickly build their own MapReduce job.

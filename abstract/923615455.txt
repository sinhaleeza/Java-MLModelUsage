The fast development of powerful mobile devices and rich Internet applications have boosted the production of Mobile Web applications designed to support end-users in their daily activities using smartphones. When these applications are the result of combining multiple heterogeneous data and services, the traditional one-size-fits-all development approach is not convenient since it does not consider the specificities of each potential user. New techniques and tools are then required to offer applications that better fit end-users constraints, preferences, and contexts while allowing them creating, consuming and sharing added-value services. We present in this article a novel mashup approach based on configuration theory and a visual tool that achieves this goal. As a proof of concept, we present an implementation scenario in the tourism domain.

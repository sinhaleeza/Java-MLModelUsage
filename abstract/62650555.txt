How to find a suitable service for a user is a challenging task. This paper introduces a method of concept categorization with the use of personal ontology to select more suitable service according to the preferences of users. In addition, a new attribute called 'reformation' is added to evaluate service quality. Our method is to aide the evaluation process with user preferences to reflect the fact that the user difference will affect the selection of different service providers.

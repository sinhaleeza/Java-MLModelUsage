In systems that require several services to collaborate, specifying coordination protocols is vital, but costly. Additionally, several properties, which are derived from laws, regulations, requirements, etc., must be satisfied. Coordination protocol composition approaches construct specific protocols in a cost effective manner in accordance with the composition intentions. However, existing composition approaches are insufficient in terms of satisfying properties. Existing approaches use concrete specifications to identify composition intentions and do not consider interference between compositions. Herein we propose a new composition approach in which a developer directly expresses his or her intentions as constraints via metadata, and then the system searches for optimal composition methods based on the constraints.

Web service composition lets users create value-added composite Web services on existent services, where top-k composite services are helpful for users to find a satisfying composite service efficiently. However, with an increasing number of Web services and users' various composition preferences, computing top-k composite services dynamically for different users is difficult. In view of this challenge, a top-k composite services selection method is proposed, based on a preference-aware service dominance relationship. Concretely speaking, firstly, user preferences are modeled with the preference-aware service dominance, and then, in local service selection, a multi-index based algorithm is proposed, named Multi-Index, for computing candidate services of each task dynamically. Then, in global optimization, combined with a service lattice, top-k composite services are selected under a dominant number-aware service ranking. At last, an experiment is presented to verify our method.

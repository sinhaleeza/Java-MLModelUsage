The current efforts on programming grid applications often rely on service-oriented approaches like grid services. This work presents HOC-SA -a service architecture for higher-order components, which provides the programmer with reusable and composable patterns of parallelism and is interoperable with the latest Globus toolkit implementations. We describe our implementation of HOC-SA using OGSA-DAI, a framework for integrating grids with distributed databases. We present a simple example application and report first measurements on our grid testbed.

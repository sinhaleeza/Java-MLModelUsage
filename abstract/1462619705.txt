The increasing popularity of modern virtualization-based datacenters continues to motivate both industry and academia to provide answers to a large variety of new and challenging questions. In this paper we aim to answer focusing on one such question: how to improve performance and availability of services hosted on IaaS clouds. Our system, structural constraint-aware virtual machine placement (SCAVP), supports three types of constraints: demand, communication and availability. We formulate SCAVP as an optimization problem and show its hardness. We design a hierarchical placement approach with four approximation algorithms that efficiently solves the SCAVP problem for large problem sizes. We provide a formal model for the application (to better understand structural constraints) and the datacenter (to effectively capture capabilities), and use the two models as inputs to the placement problem. We evaluate SCAVP in a simulated environment to illustrate the efficiency and importance of the proposed approach.

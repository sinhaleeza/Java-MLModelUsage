The lack of accuracy is the main issue in language service research. One reason is the negligence of accommodating users and their cultures in discovering, composing, and organizing services. On the other hand, a community behavior is mostly mirrored in jargons, common sentences, mottos and so forth. Moreover, culture is inseparable to its contents. Most culture disputes are due to cultural contents that can be represented in images, audio and videos. These two features of culture analysis and contents are currently not available in language services. Our main contribution is that we provided a necessary framework of service discovery, composition and organization for cultural language service to solve this problem. In service discovery, we implemented semantic similarity in cultural language services by utilizing language service ontology. In service composition, we presented hybrid language service architecture to provide multi level analysis in cultural text and culture contents in multimedia. In service organization, we provided multi-objective constraint optimization that is able to accommodate the characteristic of language services organized in multi culture environment.

A variety of methods have been proposed for selection of service providers as well as adaptation of business processes to manage service providers. However, each method is discussed under a certain set of often implicit assumptions or expectations. It has thus not clearly discussed how selection methods and adaptation methods can be chosen and combined in a consistent way with each other and with the target business process. This paper provides an overview of our study toward an analysis, design and implementation framework to promote consistent use of service selection methods and process adaptation methods with different assumptions.

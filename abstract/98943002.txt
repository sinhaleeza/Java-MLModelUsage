We propose an integrated framework that manages changes in long term composed services. The main procedure of change reaction is presented. One of the most challenging research issues of change management is how to automate the process of change reaction. To address this issue, we propose a semantic support, which centers around a tree-structured Web service ontology. The ontology is expected to provide sufficient semantic for change reaction. We propose a set of algorithms for efficiently querying semantics from the ontology. We conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

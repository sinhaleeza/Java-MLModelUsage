WSLAs can be viewed as describing the service aspect of Web services. By their nature, Web services are distributed. Therefore, integrating support code into a Web service application is potentially costly and error prone. Viewed from this AOP perspective, then, we present a method for integrating WSLAs into code generation using the AXpect weaver, the AOP technology for Infopipes. This helps to localize the code physically and therefore increase the eventual maintainability and enhance the reuse of the WSLA code. We then illustrate the weavers capability by using a WSLA document to codify constraints and metrics for a streaming image application that requires CPU resource monitoring.

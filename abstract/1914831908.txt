Global IT Services and Consulting organizations like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have been investing considerable resource into the emerging discipline of Services Computing. The address focuses on the business drivers for Services Computing across multiple industries across the world and why this could be the 'silver bullet' for many of our challenges. The address uses the TCS framework for Services Computing as a backdrop - across services strategy, services implementation and most importantly services governance. This is a progressive approach towards bridging the gap between 'what IT delivers' and 'what the business wants' through a well defined 'value measurement framework.' This framework links organizational readiness, solution maturity, and delivery assurance. Finally, the importance of aligning the competencies and roles across different parts of the organization and its stakeholders is examined.
